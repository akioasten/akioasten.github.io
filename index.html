 Gamemasters
 A gamemaster is a adminstrator as well as doing various
 other tasks such as working on the phb. If you feel someone
 is cheating or have a question about the rules this is the best
 person to approach respectfully and being mindful of their
 time. (Please ask on the server first, a player might be able to
 clarify a rule for you before you bother a gm)

 Storytellers
 Storytellers are the guys who actually run stuff and
 responsible for the story of the game. Feel free to direct all
 the questions about it at them. In fact a good player would
 ping them once a day with a question about the setting and
 post questions on their facebook.

 Assistant Storytellers
 These people might run something, sometime, but don't
 expect anything out of them and asking them to do somehting
 for you is banworthy. Its considered good luck to order these
 people pizza.

 Shuddap Nappa
 Ahem welcome to the wonderful world of neodragonballz, a
 persistant world which has existed for over a decade in
 various incarnations.
 A persistant world is a living rp, in which you can rp at any
 time, spar with players, interact, have all kinds of drama
 without even a GM or ST present.
 The system is a d20 game with a dose of number crunching.
 If you have have played 2e or 3e DnD you will be finnnnnne.
 The bot itself mostly functions as a calculator for you!.
 Speaking of the bot, here you go
 Using It
 /r 1d8 + 4d6 - Roll one octahedron and four hexahedrons.
 /r 1d20+5 # Grog attacks - Roll dice with a comment.
 /r 2d6>=5 - Roll two hexahedrons and take only the ones
 that turned greater or equal to five (aka difficulty check).
 Prints the number of successes.
 /r 4d6=5 - So can this guy roll five?
 /r 3d10>=6f1 - oWoD roll: rolling one is a failure, rolling
 more failures than successes is a botch.
 /r 1d10>=8f1f2 - Rolling one or two is a failure.
 /r 4dF - Fudge/Fate dice.
 /r 3d6! - Exploding dice.
 /r 1d10!>9 - Explode nine and ten.
 /r 1d20r1 - Roll twenty, reroll on one (because halflings are
 lucky).
 /r 3d10!>=8 - nWoD roll: tens explode, eights and up are
 treated like a success.
 /r 2d20k1 - Roll twice and keep the highest roll (D&D 5e
 advantage).
 /r 2d20k1 + 2 - Roll twice and keep the highest roll, with a
 modifier (D&D 5e advantage).
 /r 2d20kl1 - Roll twice and keep the lowest roll (D&D 5e
 disadvantage).
 /r 4d6k3 - Roll four hexahedrons and keep the highest
 three (D&D 5e ability roll).
 /r repeat (4d6k3, 6) - Roll D&D 5e ability score six times (to
 generate a new character).
 /r repeat (d6, 3, brief) - In Nomine. 1, 1, 1.
 /r ova (5) - OVA. 6, 6, 1, 1, 1 = 12.
 //roll-dice3-sides999 - AOL syntax. Dice noir.
 /r (2+2)^2 - Do math.
 /r 4d6^2 - Do math with dice.
 You can save the rolls for later!
 /r $persuasion = 2d20k1+3 - Remember the roll.
 /r $persuasion - Use the memorized roll again.
 /r $persuasion = - Remove it.
 /r $MAX_STR = 22 - All-caps named rolls belong to the
 channel and can be used by any user in it.
 /r $ - List the memorized rolls.

Rules
 These are the basic rules of the game and
 are mandatory. If you fail to read these,
 then that
 '
 s your fault.
 1) You may only have a single character.
 Some rare cases are an exception, but they are mentioned in
 the PHB itself. In all normal cases, you will only make a
 single character and keep it until he or she dies or you decide
 to retire them in favor of a new one.
 If a character dies and is later restored to life and you have
 already made a replacement character, you must choose
 between going back to your old character and discarding the
 new one or to reject your old character and keep the new one.
 2) Creating.
 When you make a character, a GM or a Roll Watcher must be
 present to witness the creation. This is called Rollwatching
 or RW'ing.
 This can be inconvenient or even annoying to all parties
 involved at times, but in the past there have been extreme
 cases of cheating so this is required. Having your character
 planned out before looking for a GM/Rollwatcher helps keep
 it quick.
 If it's extremely difficult to find people who can watch your
 rolls, please tell us so we can look at appointing dedicated
 RW'ers.
 You must be on the roster, so this step is mandatory to play- there are no exceptions. This is a bit redundant now on
 discord, so just send the GMs a whisper with your shareable
 sheet link.
 3) Time is Different.
 On a global level, time flows seven times as fast in the game
 as in real life. When the rules refer to a period in 'Neo weeks',
 they actually mean real life days for the players. During this
 time, the characters will experience a full week's time. On a
 smaller scale, seven minutes in real life are one hour in the
 world of Neo Dragon Ball Z. This smaller unit of time is
 sometimes referred to as 'Neo hours'.
 Also, a single round of combat is about one minute of game
 time. Though, it will often take much longer for the players.
 This rarely comes into effect, but it might be necessary to
 know how much longer it will take for reinforcements to
 arrive. If you're due to arrive, it's at the end of the round.
 However, already being there is slightly different.
 Time, also, flows differently when people are roleplaying. If
 it takes seven minutes for a few sentences to be spoken, an
 hour of game time didn't pass during that roleplay.
 4) Role-playing is primary.
 We do not force anybody to live up to a certain, subjective
 standard. But, we encourage everybody to roleplay as well as
 they can and be reasonably realistic or empathic.
 For example if someone cuts off your arm, react to it. Don't
 just talk... Actually act as if your arm had been cut off!

 Contents
 5) Make sure your character is on the
 roster.
 After rolling your character, make sure that whoever watched
 your rolls added your character's name, uniques, stats, race,
 and date created to the roster before you begin playing.
 Simply put, if your character isn't on the roster; they don't
 exist. This is especially important if the GM you roll to in
 whispers does not have red name. Ensure they update your
 info!
 6) The logs on the character sheets must
 be filled out and accurate.
 GMs will often sheet pull players to ensure everybody is
 playing by the rules, especially during a DM or mass fight in
 which stakes are high. If your character sheet is asked for
 and these logs are not filled out or are filled
 improperly/cheating, you will lose experience, money, or
 schools depending on the severity of the case. You must use
 the logs provided in Chapter 8, Section 5. There are no
 exceptions. None! None at all, never, no exceptions, absolutely
 none, none, none! If you do not do this repeatedly, you may
 even see your character deemed illegal and deleted from the
 roster!
 However, this does not mean that a single minor
 miscalculation with your addition will get you declared illegal.
 If it's obviously an honest mistake and hasn't had any severe
 effect, you'll probably receive a small penalty or none at all,
 providing that it's fixed immediately. On the other hand, gross
 negligence or incomprehensible logs are no better than not
 filling the logs out at all.

7) In a fight, you must roleplay your
 action. Then, you need to state in
 (parenthesis) to explain what the action
 means.
 Using an attack. For example, I used Punch with Combat
 Teleport (or CT) and Bulk-Up (or Bulk). Your opponent knows
 exactly what to expect when they plan their defense. Sure, it's
 a little easy for the defender when you declare such things,
 but it means that nobody is cheating when they declare an
 offense.
 Any add-ons, such as Focused from the Focus Unique and
 so on, must be declared. Basically if it alters your strike,
 damage, or defense in any way; you must declare it. For
 obvious reasons, Autocrit, Double Autocit, or Triple Autocrit
 Invents or Powers must be declared.
 Things you don't need to declare are after-effects such as
 Bleed, Flaming, Stun, and so on.
 When you are using shields/auras to defend, you must
 show the damage reduction when calculating it. Usually, you
 also list the ki cost associated, but that's not a requirement.
 For example: Zorpheus runs in with his blade held back
 against his arm. Casually, he begins to spin around his
 opponent while his muscles explode outwards and grip the
 blade viciously. A spark of energy runs up the end of his blade
 and explodes upon his opponent when it nears him. During
 the explosion, Zorpheus disappears to come from behind and
 slice inwards with his wicked blade! (Sword Invent, MBulk,
 ACT. AC)
 As you see. First, there is a roleplay of what the character
 does and a description of the attack, followed by an
 explanation of what it is in mechanical terms enclosed in
 parenthesis.
 To continue the example: Khisanth covers his body in
 fright, squealing like a little girl. Suddenly, a shield erupts
 around him to try and stop the awesome might of the attack!
 (Power Block)
 Again, there is first a roleplay of the action, though less
 detailed this time. Then in parenthesis, there is a statement
 of exactly what it is in mechanical terms.
 Zorpheus would now roll damage. Let's say that he gets a
 1000. Due to being Autocrit, it's UP so it'd be difficult to
 shield. But, Khisanth is a Human and has access to a UP
 shield. Khisanth now calculates how much of that damage he
 can (or wants to) stop and shows his calculations in the chat
 room. This makes it so Zorpheus can see he's not cheating
 and also allows for other people to correct any math errors
 he makes.
 The calculation might look something like this:
 [(1000-900)/2-50] = 0 Damage, 900 Ki cost.
 At this point, Khisanth would have to state what shield he's
 using. In this case, it was Martial Artist Supreme Shield.
 In addition to the above, if you are using a persistent
 defense such as an Armor, Ki Shield, Solid Aura or anything
 else that has a set amount of HP; you must not only state
 what shield you're using but must also show the reduction in
 its HP and how much it has left. This is done as [Defense's
 HP prior to the attack - Damage]. Or, if the damage is higher,
 you reverse the order and thats how much HP damage you
 take.
 8) Obvious metagaming or exploits are
 considered cheating.
 Metagaming means using out-of-character knowledge in
character. An example of the kind of metagaming described
 above would be knowing what two people are planning to do
 when you only saw them dsicussing it when your character
 was not there, but you were idling in the room OOC and then
 spreading that information with your character. Or as another
 example, knowing that if you kill a Buu or Cell; all the people
 they absorbed will be spit back up. This kind of metagaming
 can be punished with an xp penalty or worse.
 Typical metagaming, things like distrusting somebody who
 you only know dislikes you OOCly, is also not acceptable. But,
 this is very hard to prove. Because of this, in normal
 situations; nobody will be declared illegal for it. If it becomes
 a serious problem with one person, a player can decide to opt
 out of interaction with that person. However, they can still
 sense them down and force combat if they desire.
 Even obvious, extreme metagaming does not necessarily
 mean that a person will be declared illegal immediately.
 However, it IS cheating. If the GMs believe that the best
 solution is do make the character illegal, they will do so.
 Also falling under the category of obvious metagaming is
 asking people OOCly for IC benefits, things like Champion,
 Majin, IT and techniques or schools that can be taught. If
 your character even knows that they can be taught and wants
 them, they have to request and earn them IC.
 9) Attacks should be described within
 reason.
 This rule isn't made to restrict people's creativity. If you want
 your ki blasts to be fireballs, that's fine. If you want them to
 be beams of pure energy or lasers or spontaneous
 explosions, that's okay as well. However, a ki attack should
 not be a punch any more than a hand-to-hand attack should
 be shooting somebody with eye lasers.
 Be sensible with its appearance, but go nuts with its
 description.
 10) Break down your rollers if requested.
 It's very easy to mistakenly add something that doesn't apply,
 such as a superspeed that you accidentally forgot to remove
 or whatever. If this is the case, do your best to rectify the
 problem openly in chat, even by omitting (undoing) what
 happened or reducing/increasing damage done to your
 opponent, providing this is okay. In the case of strike
 modifiers, simply state it is +x or -x on top of whatever you
 rolled, preferably before defense or damage is rolled.
 If you're a Restricted class and wish to keep something
 secret, you must reasonably explain the modifier to the
 person, but ensure you tell a GM you have disguised it as
 such. Only use this if you wish to prevent metagaming. Be
 smart when using this option since there are players who can
 identify this.
 Should you forget to use something but paid for it. Instead
 of forcing damage upon someone, simply refund the cost and
 state this in chat.

11) Rolls are rounded DOWN.
 Unless otherwise stated on a specific move or power, all rolls
 with a decimal point are considered to be rounded down. If
 your strike roll is 78.8769 and their dodge is 78, they dodged,
 even if you did have a micro amount higher.
 The exception to this rule is suppression ki costs. If they
 have a decimal, they are considered to be rounded up.
 12) If in doubt; ask.
 If you're not sure if X applies or if you're doing something
 right, just ask a more experienced player or a GM. The PHB
 is heavily under work and sometimes can be contradictory or
 difficult to read. If you find something like this, tell a GM so
 they can work to amend it and make a final ruling.
 13) WiP
 The PHB is largely a work of many different people, spanning
 many years. There are many parts that are out of date,
 contradictory, or just plain wrong. That's not to say the PHB
 doesn't have accurate information. We're working on it. So if
 you find something that seems out of place or contradicting
 to another part of the PHB, let us know so we can work to
 correct that.
 14) Skimming a little off the top.
 Let's just make this clear. Giving yourself a little extra
 endurance, or ki, or hp, or anything is not acceptable
 behaviour ever. It's your responsibility to keep your sheet
 accurate at all times. No playing by memory. Track
 everything. Otherwise, you may see yourself losing XP, or if
 it's severe enough; declared illegal.
 GMs do track your expenditures and damage. Believe it or
 not, some players do too. If they have a reasonable suspicion
 that you could be cheating, a GM may be asked to check.
 If you ever catch a cheater or even just somebody who
 abuses a loophole/exploit in the rules, please log it and report
 it to a GM. This is a game and as such should be fun for all
 parties involved. Bending or breaking the rules to give oneself
 an unfair advantage spoils the game for others. It's the job of
 the GMs to make sure that this doesn't happen, punish
 offenders, and close loopholes.
 OOC nagging will not be tolerated and OOC in general
 should be kept to a minimum especially while players are IC.
 Neo should be fun and not stressful. In events, this is
 especially true where OOC can often slow down or drown out
 IC. There will be a three strike rule:
 1) Warning from a GM
 2) EXP dock not to exceed 200 EXP
 3) Booting
 For example, if you think your opponent forgot something in
 his strike roller, politely discuss it with him in whispers.

Character Creation 101: In 6 Easy
 Steps and letters/fractions
 A GM or RW will watch you roll your character. So if you
 want to make a character, read this handy guide. If you find
 you have questions, feel free to ask in chat and senior
 members or GMs will be able to provide you with an answer.
 You must have a member of staff watch you roll your
 character, no exceptions. The format for adding a character
 to the roster is as follows and should be sent to a GM when
 all the steps are complete. Player Name / Character Name /
 Race / Racial Class (if applicable) / Path / Fighting Style /
 Unique 1 / Unique 2 / Unique 3 / Developmental Unique /
 You, by no means, have to go in order of this guide and can go
 out of order, but you must have the above line of information
 complete to add to the roster.
 1) - Choose which race you want to play. Take a look through
 the Racial Charts we have available, a basic guide is as
 follows: Low Races level faster, tend to have access to more
 schools quicker and start slowly/weak. They have access to
 very interesting racial abilities that they are 'known' for.
 Medium Races tend to level reasonably well and specialize in
 a singular field of the game. Though, there are exceptions to
 this. They tend to pick up mid-game and might be weakest
 starting out. Most races are Mediums and can differ from one
 to the next. High Races tend to start out strong and level off
 as they progress while low and medium races catch up. If
 your choice involves a Restricted Racial Class, you must
 write up a background & plan then submit it to the GMs for
 their approval.
 Note: Restricteds are limited this restart.
 Approval should be within the week, but bugging GMs
 about it may see it set back or canceled. A GM needs to be
 able to trust a player with this kind of powerful character. A
 GM reserves the right to refuse an application based on
 several OOC factors. After this approval, or if you are a
 normal Racial Class, copy and paste the racial information
 from the Race's section and paste it in the racial information
 section in your character sheet as normal. As a Restricted,
 you are expected to complete additional goals or 'things' that
 GMs might assign you to do. For example, a Buu may be
 required to have no allies or friends, but may 'use' others to
 their own benefit. They are beings of destruction, afterall.
 This also provides the restart with flavour.
 2) - This is the most important steps of character creation
 mechanically: Picking Your Uniques. You are allowed a total
 of four uniques (Physical, Mental, Personality, Survival and
 Developmental). You may not have more than one unique
 from any category and must have one developmental unique.
 Try to pick out uniques that concentrate on some aspect in
 which you would like to excel. Be it Hand to Hand Fighting,
 using Ki Blasts to destroy your foes, or being lightning quick
 with a sword. Try to pick some general goal for your character
 that reflects on it. When picking Uniques, you should also
 look at what racial abilities / bonuses you get as it can
 suggest what kind of character it tends to be. For example, a
 Jeice makes an excellent ki fighter. This is due to its ability to
 dodge while charging and getting a racial Powerful Ki User
 bonus to Ki Damage. However, the same Jeice would make a
 lousy Hand to Hand Fighter or Sword User. Remember to
 record your Unique picks in your sheet.
 3) - Back to School. All characters gain a Fighting Style
 during creation. To clarify; this is the same school that is
 mentioned in each Racial node and means you only start with
 one Fighting Style, not two. This school counts towards your
 Intelligence / 10 limit. Low races may possess a racial ability
 that gives them a regular school at level 1 with the "low"
 racial stats, so make sure to check for their racials. Uniques
 such as Quick Learner may give you additional schools.
 Racial levels for certain races may also provide free schools.
 As you acquire Schools during the course of play, you may
 find you have reached your limits. You can only learn a
 number of schools not exceeding your Intelligence/10, unless
 your race or a unique states otherwise. You can find Schools
 under Chapter 4: Schools, Section 1: Regular Schools.
 4) It's all in the name. Maybe. Kinda. Not really. At this point,
 you might've already picked out a Character name, which is
 quite important and needs to be considered before you
 submit to a GM. We can't add to the roster without it! It
 doesn't have to be a name from the Dragon Ball verse, so
 long as it's sensible and you like it. Nor does it have to be
 Japanese or any other nationality, really. Can be from Space
 Australia if you really want. During this time, you should also
 check out the Chapter 2: Character Creation, Section 5:
 Alignment and Path to decide which 'side' you wish to be on.
 Note: Neutral might be the safe pick, but means the sense
 alignment power in combat is largely useless. You may over
 time opt to alter this through roleplay and should consult a
 GM if this occurs. Path helps us to determine how you see
 the world and what God you could worship. Note: Like being
 Neutral, being Pathless means that you're not interested or
 don't believe, which means you can not worship without first
 getting your path altered through roleplay over time and
 consulting a GM.
5) - Find a GM/AGM/RW listed under Game Staff and
 Online. Make sure you get in contact with a GM prior to
 sending them your information. Ask them if they're available
 to RollWatch for you. A GM may allow you to roll in whispers
 if they're engaged IC or in an Event. When they say it is ok,
 they will ask you for the following: Player Name / Character
 Name / Race / Racial Class (if applicable) / Alignment / Path /
 School / Unique 1 / Unique 2 / Unique 3 / Developmental
 Make sure it's in that format for the roster. Please have all of
 that ready before you ask. Also please provide a link to your
 character sheet they can view. (Shareable) Depending on how
 deep into the restart it is or if everyone before you got good
 rolls, you may or may not be able to roll for a Dragon Ball. If
 the result is 0 or higher, you get a Dragon Ball (if we have one
 to give)!
 6) Aftermath.
 Okay so you're now on the roster. Now, you have several
 sub-steps to complete in order to bring your sheet up to a
 completed level and be able to play. "What?! There's more?"
 You ask? Yes, but it gets easier with time and levels follow a
 similar kind of progressive thought. 6a: Background - By now,
 you likely have a concept to play with and a name to go on. A
 background can be anything from one page to thirty, as
 detailled as you want or as simple as you like. By submitting
 a background, you're offering the GMs with ideas of side-plots
 that they may use characters from your past to create more
 indepth restarts. This background should also help influence
 the other aspects of your character, explain them, or
 otherwise give reason to why he or she is the way he or she
 is. Example; you've taken the Immortal Technique on a
 Namek, so you write your background as follows: Dusty has
 existed for longer than his memory recalls. No time is worth
 remembering in particular and his current strength has
 slowly been accelerating from a meaningless single digit.
 Finally, he's taken his first steps towards a respectable power
 and it's escalating rapidly from there. He'd need it. He
 clenches his sword with anger as he moves forward through
 the Human World's desert he crash landed upon. Not a
 terribly good background, but could be built upon easily
 enough. Once it's written out, ask a GM so you can submit it
 to them. They may refer you to another member of staff
 because they don't deal with backgrounds. Based on how
 much you give them to enjoy reading/work with, they will give
 you a starting boost of experience. You should also take the
 time to give your character some basic short term goals,
 followed by one or two long term goals. If your goals involve
 your history/background, don't expect a GM to run an event
 just for you. But if it can involve more people without
 centralising around a single character, it may be considered.
 XP given to you from a background should be recorded in
 your Battle Log.
 6b: Stats - Remember, you get starting distribution stats
 found under the race information.Example: "Statistics (45
 additional points, max of 15 in 1 stat)" This can be found
 above your race's starting stats. You should use these points
 before you apply anything else. Next, apply any additional
 stats your Development Unique may provide. Followed by the
 "other race" School stats, unless otherwise specifically stated.
 Remember to log every stat you add to your sheet using the
 Stat Breakdown log. This is usually what GMs will look at to
 make sure your sheet is correct. And they do look. Failure to
 keep this up-to-date may result in xp penalties and using
 combat values that do not equal your stat breakdown and
 HP/Ki mods or endurance may result in penalties or removal
 from the roster.
 6c: Powers - Some races get free powers on creation, so
 carefully read through your racial information for this
 information. Then, you pick your race's number of powers on
 creation, which will be found in your racial information. Next,
 add the powers you get from your Fighting Style and record
 the School in your Logs, along with the Powers chosen/given.
 Remember, when creating or levelling up, you may only
 spend up to half of your powers in one tree unless you
 possess a Unique that enables this rule to change. For
 example, if you start with 5 Powers - 5/2 = 2.5, rounded down
 to 2 powers per tree. Racial powers do not apply to this limit.
 When you level up however, you may only take 1 power per
 tree. So for example, you gain 3 Powers in your level up. You
 would have to pick one from three trees.
 6d: Health / Etc - Having done your powers and stats,
 you're now able to work out your Health (HP) / Ki mods if you
 haven't done so already. Races will have a listed HP / Ki Mod
 which will be a number. For example, a Dodorian has a HP
 mod of 16. Without Uniques to raise it, his or her HP would
 be calculated as: 16sSTM+60*level. You should also take the
 time to work out your Ki (similar to HP above), Endurance,
 Lifepoints (LP) amount, and your resistance. It also might be
 a good time to work out your Powerlevel - [((Current HP+
 Current Ki)x(STR+DEX+SPD)x(Current Life Points/Max
 Life Points))/10] to establish how strong you are. Level 1 Low
 characters tend to range from 8-15k. While, Mid races tend
 to vary from 10-20k. High races can be anywhere between
 10-30k. Any extras that should be tracked during a fight, such
 as Ki Shield, Final Ki Attacker Counter, Solid Aura and so on
 should also be listed and worked out in this step.
 6e: Invents - Possibly one of the most difficult steps in the
 game, some people simply ignore invents. However if you
 take the time to stop and read them, then develop them; they
 can become some of your most powerful moves - moreso
 than School invents even. To learn more about Invents, go to
 Chapter 3: Powers and Invents, Section 2: Invents. Invents,
 when made, should be recorded somewhere in your sheet.
6f: Strike / Dodge / Etc - Now may be a good time to work out
 your strike/dodge/damage rollers ready for combat.
 Remember each time your stats improve and each level up,
 you should ensure they are up to date. Remember that part of
 your Misc mods is level x 10 damage and applies to all
 damage (including Telekinetic Damage) unless misc mods
 are specifically stated not to apply. Remember to check your
 uniques / racial information for additional bonuses.
 6g: Reputation / Money - Every character begins play with
 500 Credits to make any purchases they want, be it swords or
 training equipment. Make sure to check equipment (such as
 armor) that does not have a level limit, before you purchase it.
 In addition to fights and mugging other characters, you get
 100 credits each day that passes. You should use get_restart
 or ask what time a day rolls over in order to record this
 accurately. As well as credits, you also get 1 Reputation point
 for every day that passes and should be logged in your
 Reputation log.
 6h: Final Step; Late Creation - When you roll up a
 character, a GM may remember to tell you what day you've
 created on.
 For every day you made late, you receive the following:
 1 day of Training - See Chapter 2: Character Creation,
 Section 8: Character Advancement: Training, for more
 info. You do NOT get Experience training.
 400 Experience. Alternatively, if you're remaking a
 character or it died, you can optionally take 50% of your
 last characters Experience.
 100 Credits, as if you'd taken them daily as mentioned in
 6g.
 1 Rep point, as if you'd taken them daily as mentioned in
 6g
 The Cycle of Life! Until you dieeeeee.
SPD - Speed
 Attributes:
 A Character is expressed in several numbers, most
 importantly of all the six main statistics. Here is a brief
 description of all six of them, and their game-mechanical use.
 All fractions are rounded down. So when you have to divide
 14 by 5 the result is 2, while 15 would give a result of 3.
 Main Statistics
 INT - Intelligence
 Despite its name, intelligence doesn't really mean how smart
 you are, though you're free to roleplay it that way. It
 represents your mental quickness, how quickly you can
 notice details and reach critical decisions.
 INT/5 Is added to your Initiative rolls.
 INT/30 Is used to calculate your Actions Per Round.
 INT/10 The maximum number of Schools you can know,
 unless stated otherwise.
 MNT - Mental
 Your mental attribute represents how much raw Ki you have
 and how well you can handle it.
 MNT/5 Your bonus to damage and strike rolls with ki attacks.
 MNT Is directly used to calculate how much Ki you have,
 according to Race.
 STR - Strength
 Your Strength, quite simply, represents how strong you
 physically are. It is your brute force.
 STR/5 Your bonus to damage rolls with H2H attacks
 STR/5 Your modifier to Parry Blast rolls.
 Str/10 May be used as a modifier for Sword Damage if its
 higher than speed/5
 STR Is the primary stat needed for wearing Weighted
 Clothing.
 DEX - Dexterity
 Your Dexterity represents how agile you are and how well
 your reflexes are.
 DEX/5 Your modifier to strike rolls with HtH and Sword
 strikes.
 DEX/5 Your modifier to HtH and Sword parries.
 DEX/35 Is used to calculate your Actions Per Round.
 STM - Stamina
 Your Stamina represents how healthy you are, how much
 punishment you can take before going down, and your ability
 to fight of fatigue.
 STM Is used to calculate how much HP you have, according
 to Race.
 STM Is used to calculate how much Endurance you have.
 STM Is used to calculate how much LP you have, according
 to Race.
 Notes: - Anything that states it costs STM or Stm Points
 costs Endurance.
 Table of
 Contents
 Your Speed represents how fast you are.
 SPD/5 Your modifier to all Dodge rolls. Speed/5 Your
 modifier to Sword Damage. SPD/25 Is used to calculate your
 Actions Per Round.
 SPD/25 Is added to your Initiative rolls.
 SPD Is used to calculate how fast you can fly.
 Level
 Your level is used to determine a number of things.
 You gain two powers every level. You gain an Invent every
 fourth level (1, 4, 8, 12, etc.)
 Some races gain Schools, Stats, and increased Hp/Ki mods.
 10
Derived Statistics
 1) HP Hit Points This number represents your health, how
 much damage you can take before collapsing. The equation
 for calculating your HP is:
 (STM x Racial Modifier)+(Racial Bonus x Level)
 The racial modifier and bonus can be found under each
 race's description. Androids use STR instead of STM to
 determine HP, as they don't have an STM stat.
 The above shows you how to find your maximum hit
 points. You also have current hit points, which is your
 maximum HP minus any damage you've taken. Lost hit
 points are restored out of battle at a rate described in
 Chapter 6. When your hit points reach zero or below, you are
 unconscious.
 2) Ki Sometimes known as chi, this is the energy of the
 universe and life itself. All living things have some amount of
 ki in them, but in some cases (such as a blade of grass or a
 small insect) it's so little as to be almost negligible. Ki is used
 to power many special abilities. The equation for calculating
 your maximum Ki is:
 (MNT x Racial Modifier)+(Racial Bonus x Level)
 The racial modifier and bonus can be found under each
 race's description. Like HP, Ki can be lost in battle, and out of
 battle is restored depending on the time.
 3) End - Endurance This also represents your ability to
 keep fighting, but whereas running out of HP means your
 body has taken too much damage to keep functioning,
 running out of Endurance is collapsing from exhaustion.
 Endurance is typically equal to your STM score. If it is
 anything different it will be noted in a unique you choose or
 in a racial node. If your Endurance ever reaches zero, you are
 rendered unconscious. You cannot use a move that would
 take you to negative Endurance.
 Note: There might be places in the PHB which refer to this
 as "stamina count" or says that something costs "stamina." In
 these cases it means your Endurance, not your Stamina stat
 itself, unless clearly specified otherwise.
 4) LP - Life Points This is the narrow margin that
 separates enough damage to knock you out from a fatal
 injury, and your soul's will to continue to exist that pulls you
 back from the brink of death. Your LP based off of your STM
 score, and the exact amount varies according to race.
 You begin to lose LP after you have run out of HP, and if
 your LP reaches zero you are almost always dead. The rare
 exceptions to this rule are races which have a special set of
 Hit Points, or Sub-LP, that exist after their LP have run out--
 although they will appear dead they can heal back from this
 point.
 5) APR - Actions Per Round This is how many actions your
 character may take in a given round (one minute).
 The formula for this is: INT/30+DEX/35+SPD/25
 Notes: - You cannot have less than +1 APR from each stat.
 This isn't a bonus to your actions per round, it simply means
 that your base APR, before being modified by uniques,
 cannot be less than three. For example, if you have 50 SPD,
 30 INT, and 20 DEX, you get four actions every round: two
 from SPD, one from INT, and one from DEX. When your
 DEX reached 40, you would still only have one action from it.
 6) PL - Power Level Your power level generally exists only
 to gauge how poweful you are, especially in comparison to
 other people. The higher someone's power level, the more
 formidable they are--however, it only measures raw ability, not
 skill or many other factors, so it's only accurate to a certain
 extent. The following formula is used to determine your
 power level:
 ((HP+KI)x(STR+DEX+SPD)x(Current Life Points/Max
 Life Points)) /10
 Notes: - You still have a powerlevel as long as you
 have any HP or Ki. So if your at zero ki, but half HP
 then you still have a powerlevel. This mainly applies
 if you use a power such as Ki's ending. - If you are
 knocked into LP, you still have a powerlevel, unless
 you specifically use a power which states you give
 off no powerlevel (e.g., Taisha Charge). - Anyone
 without any Life Points remaining has no
 powerlevel - Therefore if a character is in their Sub
LP, they do not have any powerlevel.
 7) Initiative - The first thing you do in combat, is roll your
 combat Initiative to determine the order of your actions so
 you can beat on one another. You should be able to find your
 Inititative roller in your character sheet and fill it in as
 required, but there's a few additional tidbits of information
 you can add; more information for your opponent, the better.
 Initiative is calculated with the formula (Int/5+Spd/25).
 8) Strike, Parry, Dodge
 9) Resistance
 10) Modifiers (Mods)
 11) And the Rest
 (Regen, Natrual Armor/Shields, Sub-LP, etc.)

O P
 ath
 utside of crunched numbers exists the reason
 your character breathes.
 What is he doing in the Neo Universe? Is he
 a fallen god bent on bringing the Kaioshins to
 their knees or is he an angel sent to protect the
 innocent from the strong?
 This section is here to help you flesh out
 your character's purpose and provide a reason why they act
 the way they do.
 Path: Every character has a path like they have an
 alignment. They are similar to alignments, but provide added
 depth; an Evil Mercy character could argue that he is killing
 or dominating for the good of others, while a Good
 Retribution character might see vengence over justice.
 Paths also provide you with a God to worship or represent,
 doing so can have some interesting benefits even in death.
 Note: It is possible to have your path shifted by a GM if you
 do not act the part or request change.
 Maybe you don't deny the Kaioshin's exist, but you don't
 worship them or believe they are the Gods they make out to
 be. There are varying beliefs or reasons for this but for the
 purposes of simplicity, anyone who does not worship them
 are considered 'Pathless'.
 Pathless count as a "different path" to those who do follow
 one of the paths, despite its name.
 Balance:
 "Do you call it a pitiful life for a man to lead looking that way,
 observing that vision by the proper means and having it ever
 with him? Do but consider, she said, that there only will it
 befall him, as he sees the beautiful through that which makes
 it visible, to breed not illusions but true examples of virtue,
 since his contact is not with illusion but with truth. So when
 he has begotten a true virtue and has reared it up he is
 destined to win the friendship of Heaven, he, above all men,
 is immortal." (Plato)
 The universe constantly teeters somewhere between the
 brink of destruction and a holy paradise, while more often
 than not it is somewhere in between. Things get dangerous
 when the universe tends towards one side or the other. You
 know there are no absolutes - everything is a shade of grey
 and always should be. When the scales tip too far to one side
 the universe becomes a tyranny of the majority and you step
 up to the place to assist the underdog.
 The Path of Balance is acknowledging that while rampant,
 unfettered chaos is bad and so is perfect order.
 The downside is Balance is too concerned with the big
 picture to realize it can be the small things that matter to a
 person. Maintaining this Path that Balance characters believe
 in, is hard and unfortunately what exactly needs to be done to
 maintain it is the vaguest of all the Paths to choose.
 There is a harmony in the universe, Balance has an
 intuitive sense of what it is, and strives to maintain it.
 Retribution:
 "We are the hollow men We are the stuffed men Leaning
 together Headpiece filled with straw. Alas! Our dried voices,
 when We whisper together Are quiet and meaningless As
 wind in dry grass Or rats feet over broken glass In our dry
 cellar
 Shape without form, shade without colour, Paralysed force,
 gesture without motion,
 Those who have crossed With direct eyes, to deaths other
 Kingdom Remember us - if at all - not as lost, Violent souls,
 but only As the hollow men The stuffed men." (TS Elliot)
 Two wrongs don't make a right, but you can be sure a
 wrong must be punished! Though the cost for teaching others
 is high, you're prepared to take sin upon your soul and enact
 the second wrong as necessary thing. The ends justify the
 means, afterall.
 To you, the worlds you visit are hollow and broken, there is
 no room to let scoundrels destroy it further. Their removal is
 a necessary evil to let the innocent live with freedom in their
 hearts that their virtue has earnt them. Fury is not that of the
 righteous nor is their punishment. Sometimes an eye is
 traded for far more than another eye and worse those who
 follow Retribution often get carried away.
 Some will punish those who have even yet to commit an
 evil; simply because their "instinct" tells them it is the
 "proper" thing to do. But not all fall sway to such things,
 many have strict codes of honor that they seek to maintain
 and follow.
 Some live by the laws of justice the society they live in has
 established to whatever degree they agree with and will
 merely hunt down offenders and bring them in to the proper
 authorities to determine the right course of action.
 And still there are those who are the judge, jury and
 executioner.

Mercy:
 "The quality of mercy is not strained, It droppeth as the
 gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice
 blessed- It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes." "Do
 not stand on a high pedestal and take 5 cents in your hand
 and say, "here, my poor man", but be grateful that the poor
 man is there, so by making a gift to him you are able to help
 yourself. It is not the receiver that is blessed, but it is the giver.
 Be thankful that you are allowed to exercise your power of
 benevolence and mercy in the world, and thus become pure
 and perfect." (The Bible)
 If people are willing to change, they always deserve a
 second chance to do so. If people cannot change, then allow
 them into the arms of those who would see fair justice upon
 them. Those who follow the path of Mercy understand that
 some people do not understand and never will. Most, in fact.
 Many people lead lives that are deadly to their well being
 and those around them. Sin exists throughout the universe
 and those who practice it must be taught so that they may fix
 their ways. If their sin is dealt with by another sin, however,
 then the teacher becomes a hypocrite and meaning is lost.
 While some might be willing to accept sacrificing their soul
 to teach others, the way of Mercy suggests other ways. So
 those that have wronged others must be met with forgiveness
 and education, but every man has his breaking point
 eventually. One day even the most stalwart of heroes will
 snap and may regret their actions. Sometimes this results in
 nothing more than a few broken mountains. Yet, there are
 many who never fall from Mercy's grace and are even Sainted
 by the Church representing this Kaioshin. And those who do
 fall, well they will one day be redeemed in the afterlife.
 Order:
 "Justice implies superior character and intelligence while
 injustice means deficiency in both respects. Therefore, just
 men are superior in character and intelligence and are more
 effective in action. As injustice implies ignorance, stupidity
 and badness, It cannot be superior in character and
 intelligence. A just man is wiser because he acknowledges
 the principle of limit. Unlimited self-assertion is not a source
 of strength for any group organized for common purpose,
 Unlimited desire and claims lead to conflicts. Life of just man
 is better and happier. There is always some specific virtue in
 everything, which enables it to work well. If it is deprived of
 that virtue, it works badly. The soul has specific functions to
 perform. When it performs its specific functions, it has
 specific excellence or virtue. If, it is deprived of its peculiar
 virtue, it cannot possibly do its work well. It is agreed that the
 virtue of the soul is justice. The soul which is more virtuous
 or in other words more just is also the happier soul.
 Therefore, a just man lives happy. A just soul, in other words
 a just man, lives well, an unjust cannot." (Plato)
 Order is complete, total, perfect organisation and rule.
 There is a hierarchy and you follow it, always and without
 question. Chance has no need to exist. Miracles should not
 happen. There is no need for change and in fact, change is
 bad.
 Table of
 Contents
 Those who follow the Teachings of Order do not follow the
 teachings of a pathetic society. but civility. They have a grasp
 on an Order that is higher than mere society - fortunately part
 of that understanding is the acceptance of local envoys of
 order; the law makers in society who seek to establish rules
 and restrictions where there are none. But if the teachings of
 any society conflict with the divine order they acknowledge,
 then they will follow their heart and listen to the universe's
 needs for structure to oppose it. Without order, justice cannot
 be brought about on those who deserve to be judged.
 Chaos:
 "So, after all, there was not one kind of Strife alone, but all
 over the earth there are two. As for the one, a man would
 praise her when he came to understand her, but the other is
 blameworthy: and they are wholly different in nature. For one
 fosters evil war and battle, being cruel: her no man loves, but
 perforce, through the will of the deathless gods, men pay
 harsh Strife her honour due. But the other is the elder
 daughter of dark Night (Nyx), and the son of Cronus who sits
 above and dwells in the aether, set her in the roots of the
 earth: and she is far kinder to men. She stirs up even the
 shiftless to toil, for a man grows eager to work when he
 considers his neighbour, a rich man who hastens to plough
 and plant and put his house in good order, and neighbour vies
 with his neighbour as he hurries after wealth. This Strife is
 wholesome for men. And potter is angry with potter, and
 craftsman with craftsman, and beggar is jealous of beggar,
 and minstrel of minstrel. But abhorred Eris ('Strife') bare
 painful Ponos ('Toil/Labor'), Lethe ('Forgetfulness') and
 Limos ('Famine') and tearful Algea (Pains/Sorrows),
 Hysminai ('Fightings/Combats') also, Makhai ('Battles'),
 Phonoi ('Murders/Slaughterings'), Androctasiai
 ('Manslaughters'), Neikea ('Quarrels'), Pseudea
 ('Lies/Falsehoods'), Amphillogiai ('Disputes'), Dysnomia
 ('Lawlessness') and Ate ('Ruin/Folly'), all of one nature, and
 Horkos ('Oath') who most troubles men upon earth when
 anyone wilfully swears a false oath." (Hesoid)
 Between the idea and the reality, between the creation and
 the conception, falls the shadow of Chaos. Before the world
 was as it is now there was nothing and this state was known
 as Chaos.
 Those who blow with the winds would love nothing more
 than for this state to return. Or maybe they don't. It's hard to
 say. Chaos is not one thing or any single idea; those who
 follow it all have different plans on what they want to do or
 achieve. And few would say they are really "following"
 anything.
 Some believe they exist to bring Hell on Earth - but Hell is
 ordered, Chaos is random. Or perhaps it is Ordered Chaos.
 What is wrong to say, is that Chaos is equivalent to evil.
 The most general view of Chaos is that stagnation is the
 true evil and while this does not necessitate bringing Anarchy
 to the universe, often change is for the better and must never
 stop continuing to change.
 Before the universe existed that change was never ending,
 but returning the universe to that state would end all life and
 few are willing to devote themselves to a cause where they
 have to die in the end.
 Though, there are always exceptions who hold only distain
 for existance.

U U
 niques
 NIQUES EXPLANATION There are a total of
 five categories of uniques: Physical, Mental,
 Personality, Survival, and Developmental. All
 characters have four uniques. You may not
 take two uniques from the same category.
 One also must be chosen from the
 developmental tree.
 Physical
 These uniques are meant to improve the strength, speed,
 accuracy, and health of a fighter. These uniques primarily
 increase your ability to withstand damage and your ability to
 fight with HtH/Swords.
 Mental
 These uniques represent someone's spiritual chi and the way
 that they use it in combat. They tend to increase the user's Ki
 and/or make the user better at fighting with Ki.
 Personality
 These uniques reflect your character's actions, reactions and
 decisions. They are in no way restrictive to how you play your
 character, you don't have to take Brutal Fighting Style in
 order to play someone who fights dirty. These uniques help
 your character on a more general level than Mental or
 Physical uniques.
 Survival
 These uniques mainly focus on defensive or support abilities.
 They are used to improve the strength of your auras or your
 evasiveness.
 Developmental
 These uniques affect your character's growth and are always
 most noticeable later on. Their effect is usually minimal at
 the start, but increases as time passes.
 The two uniques listed below here are special, in that they
 don't fit into any specific category. If you wish to have either
 (or both) of these uniques, you take each Unique in place of
 another.-=( Special Uniques )=
Chosen
 (Can only be taken by Icers and Saiyans) This unique
 represents the hidden potential of a Saiyan or Icer, their
 capacity to improve, and their true limits on what they can
 achieve. Some Saiyans and Icers will live their entire lives
 never finding it.
 Effects:
 +5 to all Stats on creation.
 +1 to all stats every 3 levels (3,6,9,etc)
 +1 to Hp/Ki Modifiers.
 +level x 2 Hp/Ki Regeneration per action in any
 Superform.
 This allows you to unlock Form 5 (for Icers) or SSJ 3 (for
 Saiyans).
 Notes:
 This unique may be taken in place of a normal unique
 selection, in any category
 (Physical/Mental/Survival/Personality/Development) and
 counts as your unique selection for that category.
 You may submit a background to gain access to SSJ3 /
 Icer Form 5 without this unique. Such a background does
 not give you any other benefits of this unique.
 Enhanced Awareness
 Everyone knows how to sense the presence of others, but
 your abilities go well beyond that. You know how your aura
 can be manipulated far better than any other. People only
 know as much about you as you let them know.
 Effects:
 You can never be affected by the Ki Awareness powers
 Sense Ki, Universal Awareness and Sense Path unless
 you allow yourself to be.
 The Telekinetic power Psionic Surge causes you to lose
 any active Ki Locks against that person, but does not
 inflict a penalty.
 You can allow people to sense your path but not your
 powerlevel and vice versa.
 All Ki Awareness powers act as if you were four levels
 higher than you actually are.
 Scouters have their chance to detect you reduced, which
 stacks with the power Hide Ki. For every level you have,
 Scouters have a -10% chance to detect you. Using the
 power Increase Powerlevel negates this penalty however,
 and allows Scouters to automatically detect you.
 Once per round, you can use your Enhanced Awareness to
 predict someone's reaction. You declare you're using
 "Prediction" when you state your attack and they declare
 their defense. After they declare their defense, you can
 then declare additional powers you're using with your
 attack (Superspeeds, Bulking, etc).
 Because of the field you project, even Dragon Radars don't
 work well against you. Reduce the percentage of success
 from any Dragon Radar that tries to detect any Dragon
 Balls ysou carry by 25%.
 You may lock onto everyone in a battle using the Ki
 Awareness power Sense Ki.
 Notes:
 You may take this unique in place of your normal Physical,
 Mental, Personality or Survival Pick. You may not take this
 in place of your Developmental. It counts as a Unique in
 the category of your choosing.
 Your uniques are picked at creation and are not normally
 allowed to be changed after you've picked them and had them
 added to the roster. There are a few circumstances, however,
 where you might be allowed to change your uniques.
 GM's are pretty reasonable people, just talk to them about
 your concerns and why you need to change it.

Berserker
 Physical Uniques
 Ambidextrous
 You're as skilled with one part of your body as you are with
 another and don't favor either hand. You can write, kick,
 punch and shoot from both your arms and legs equally well.
 This has made you very popular with the ladies.
 Effects:
 Table of
 Contents
 You gain +2 to all strike rolls.
 Any time you spend an action to attack someone, you may
 perform a basic unarmed attack, basic discharge (not
 Supreme Discharge!) or basic sword attack at no cost in
 APR or END. Ki costs are paid normally. This off-hand
 attack may not benefit from Bulk or PKU. This does not
 apply to attacks made while in a grapple and you may not
 use the same weapon you used to trigger the free attack.
 Attacks that do not cost APR (such as counters), Combos
 and Invents do not provide an additional free attack.
 If you have a racial weapon (such as Konacks' Sword), you
 possess an additional one. If your race creates a weapon
 (such as a Makyo), then you may create two weapons at
 the same time--either in the same pre-round or as part of
 the same action, as appropriate to the race.
 All Critical Hit penalties you experience are halved. If you
 have the power Ignore Pain, the penalties are a fourth of
 what they normally are.
 You can use the powers Multi Kick and Multi Punch twice
 per round each.
 Once per round you may parry a Grab or a Ki Attack (not
 Telekinetics) using the powers Parrying Strike, Hand-to
Hand Parry or Telekinetic Parry. This costs an additional
 3 END ontop of the normal power costs.
 IMMA THE JUGGERNAUT BITCH
 It takes a while to truly get you angry. But when it happens,
 you tend to explode and destroy everyone and everything
 around you. Maybe it's because you like pain. Maybe it's
 because you really, really don't. Whatever the case, you're
 very good at laying the hurt on people.
 Effects:
 +2 Hp Modifier-2 to all HtH/Sword Strikes.
 +20% Damage increase with all HtH/Sword attacks.
 When you are hit below 30% of your normal, maximum
 Hit Points, you explode in anger and gain the following
 benefits:
 +4 to all HtH/Sword Strikes, which replaces the above.
 +50% Damage increase with all HtH/Sword attacks,
 which replaces the above.
 You gain Armor equal to your STM*6 through sheer
 tenacity, unless you actually grow armor when you're
 angry for some reasoon. This Natural Armor is in addition
 to any granted by race, but is counted as a seperate "pool"
 of HP that is drawn from first.
 If you ever go above 50% of your Maximum HP while in
 this state, you revert back and lose its bonuses until you
 drop back down under the 30%.
 Once these bonuses activate, you fight to the end. You fight
 until you've defeated your opponent(s), they give up or you
 are unconscious. You may only choose to surrender if you
 are put under 10% HP, using your new maximum.
 Normal Template: [(Attack Damage+STR Mod+Other
 Mods) x 1.20+bulk] Normal Template with Multis: [(Attack
 Damage+STR Mod+Other Mods) x 1.1+bulk] Berserk
 Template: [(Attack Damage+STR Mod+Other Mods) x
 1.50+bulk] Berserk Template with Multis: [(Attack
 Damage+STR Mod+Other Mods) x 1.25+bulk]
 Notes:
 The only thing the mulitplier doesn't effect is Bulks.
 The Berserk aspect of this unique is not optional. As soon
 as you go below 30% of your maximum Hit Points the
 change is automatic.
 Brawler
 You're just a good fighter. You know how to take it and you
 know how to dish it out. You like to get in fights and beat
 people up. It's time to shut up or nut up!
 Effects:
 +2 Hp Modifier.
 +3 to all HtH Strikes.
 +Level x 10 to all HtH Damages.
 All powers from the Ki Body Enhance tree have their
 costs reduced by 1/3 without affecting the amount of
 damage that can be added.
 While below half your maximum Ki, all powers from the
 Ki Body Enhance tree have their costs reduced by 2/3
 instead.
 The powers Rest and Rejuvenate give you twice as much
 Endurance as normal. If your race already grants you
 double endurance recovery on Rest and Rejuvinate, then
 you instead gain three times the normal amount of
 Endurance.
 16
Extremely Strong
 You're a brute with layers upon layers of muscle. You lift
 mountains with your bare hands! Or you could, if they weren't
 still a part of the ground and everything. Your favourite thing
 to ask puny others is 'do you even lift, brah?'
 Effects:
 +3 Hp Modifier.
 You gain +1 to your Strike Rolls.
 You begin with two additional powers from either the HtH
 or the KBE power tree
 Your STR mod is now STR/4 instead of the usual STR/5.
 If your race already grants STR/4 already, your STR mod
 does not change.
 You can parry blast kienzen. The attack cannot be parried
 back or at other targets, only away. Even on a natural 20.
 When grappling (including special/ranged grapples) an
 opponent and they attempt to do anything but flare, break,
 shift or release you, you may make a shift grapple check in
 order to prevent them from attacking you. This costs 1
 Endurance to perform. If you succeed, they pay their
 endurance and ki costs as normal, but it doesn't count
 towards their uses per round, if it has a limit.
 Goon
 You're a big person. People like to make fun of that or make
 out like you're scary, but you know what you can do and when
 you do it, you take center stage.
 Effects:
 +2 Hp Modifier.
 +3 to all HtH and Sword Strikes
 When you block, you block an additional 10% damage, so
 when you block you divide the damage by 2.5 (trust us,
 thats right). This applies to Block, Power block and
 Advanced Block only.
 Due to your large size, you can grapple people with one
 hand. It allows you to make strikes against people outside
 of a grapple while in a grapple, as well as parry and dodge
 attacks that originate outside of a grapple. You can also
 use Superspeeds while in a grapple. You can not however,
 grapple two people at one time.
 If you grapple someone and make use of the throw action,
 you can throw them at another person as a HtH strike roll
 with a -4 penalty. If it hits, they have collided with each
 other and both take throw damage and both lose an
 action. If you miss only the thrown person is affected as
 normal.
 When determining your strength for shift or break grapple
 attempts, consider your Strength 15% higher than it
 actually is. This does apply to the advaced grapple shifts
 or holds.
 Your grapple-only moves (Bearhug, Throw, etc) do 15%
 more damage. This does not affect racial grapple moves
 or invent grapple moves like Recoom Boom and
 KuroKumaKen.
 Master of Blades
 Your character is very adept at using weapons in combat. He
 can pick up a blade and within seconds knows just where its
 weighted or how to strike to get the most out of its slashing
 power.
 Effects:
 +1 to your HP and Ki Mod
 +3 to all sword strikes
 +level x 10 to sword damage.
 +STM/2 END.
 The powers Pinpoint Thrust and Perfect Strike may be
 used an additional time each per round.
 Basic Weapons do not cost you credits, but you may not
 sell or give away your "free" weapons, nor may they be
 stolen. You can also pick up any improvised weapon and
 make it act like a Basic Weapon that is appropriate to its
 form. This may even be done mid-combat as an action or
 pre-round action.
 Very Small
 You are very quick and speedy. You pride yourself in your
 ability to completely avoid damage. Though that might be
 self-induced ego due to being bullied for being so short.
 Effects:
 +2 to all Strike and Dodge rolls
 +1 APR.
 +1 Ki Modifier.
 Dodge rolls of 19 are considered a critical dodge as if
 you'd rolled a 20.
 You may use your SPD or STR to break out of grapples,
 whichever is highest. You can only use this option to break
 out of a grapple, not to shift or to hold someone else.
 Once per round, you can use the power Misdirection. This
 allows you to use your evasiveness to redirect an incoming
 attack at someone else in a fight; even the attacker! Make
 a regular dodge roll with a -6 penalty. If your dodge beats
 their strike roll, you can redirect the attack at someone
 else as if they had been attacked and not you. Your dodge
 result is the new strike they must defend against.
 Notes:
 Using freeze or any variation of the power when you use
 Misdirection does not let you automatically redirect an
 attack. Freeze can however be used as a safety net to
 evade if your dodge roll does fail.
 You can not use this power to misredirect an attack to
 someone who is not in the Initiative.
 They are both declared as Misdirects, however you
 declare the target with your dodge.

Mental uniques
 Brilliant Ki User
 You're not just smart with your usage of Ki, you're creative.
 You know how to use it in the ways it comes easiest to most,
 and you know how to combine thosse methods to create
 something wholly yours.
 Effects:
 You begin with two extra powers.
 Every level up you gain an additional power and can pick
 powers from the same tree.
 You gain an extra invent at levels 2 and 3. These bonus
 invents can not be shield invents.
 Once every two rounds (1/2), you can use the power
 Reflection. This power allows you mirror an invent you
 missed with and reattack. You do this in the same action
 you missed with the attack, costing you no extra actions.
 However you must pay the invent's cost again. Your
 opponent has to react as if it is an entirely new attack, but
 you keep all the bonuses the attack had when you first
 used it.
 Androids may take an action and expend a point from
 their Action Pool to recover Level*15 Ki, in addition to
 their normal regeneration.
 Notes:
 The damage multiplier from this unique is not halved for
 Multi Attacks.
 "Ki attacks" include: all Ki Attack Inventions, all powers
 from the Offensive Ki tree, Telekinesis, Super Telekinesis,
 Capture Ball, Ki Shaping, Psionic Entemperment and any
 other powers that call for a Ki strike and deal damage.
 The increased charging also affects the Flare power and
 Mega Charge when used with flare.
 The damage bonus applies to the Hybrid powers Ki
 Shaping and Psionic Entemperment, but the strike bonus
 does not.
 Actions taken while the Ligon's powers Mind Freeze or
 Time Freeze are active do not generate action points.
 Attacks that do not cost an action do not add to the pool.
 Template: [(Attack Damage+Mnt Mod) x 1.25+Other Mods]
 Good at Ki Control
 You can not use reflection and then use remote/double
 remote, or vice versa. You have to repay the cost for all
 superspeeds and enhancements, but you reuse all the powers
 with the bonus used in the original attack (meaning you do
 not lose limited use powers, such as Final Fist or MCT).
 However, the defender must chose a new defense, which
 means if they used powers which have a limit to them they
 may not be reused.
 Notes:
 You can not use Reflection with racial powers, except for
 racial unique invents such as a Paiku's or a Konackan's.
 Unlike Double Remote, you can not Reflect after a Freeze.
 Final Ki Attacker
 You prefer to use Ki based attacks only towards the end of a
 battle, as a finisher - as they should be used - instead of
 throwing them around as a primary attack style similar to
 how an ape throws around feces.
 Effects:
 +2 Ki Modifier.
 +2 to your H2H/Sword Strikes.
 If your last action was not a Ki attack or a power from the
 Powering Up tree, you gain a +3 dodge bonus.
 If your last action was not a Ki attack or a power from the
 Powering Up tree, add one point to an 'action pool'. This
 does not grant extra actions. The 'action pool' does not
 lose any points between rounds, but does empty at the end
 of combat.
 When you have one or more actions in your pool and use a
 ki attack, you gain a +4 bonus to Ki strikes and +25%
 damage to all Ki attacks for that action. If you used a
 power from the powering up tree, you charge 50% more
 Ki than you would normally (This does not apply to
 megacharge). Each action you gain this bonus, it drains
 one point from the 'action pool' mentioned above. Once
 the pool is empty, you no longer gain these bonuses until it
 gains more points to use.
 For most people, using Ki is a lot like using a hammer or
 club. You use Ki more like a rapier or scalpel. You know that
 pointed ends tend to work better than concussive force.
 Effects:
 +1 Ki Modifier.
 +3 to Ki Strikes.
 You begin with two extra powers from the Offensive or
 Defensive Ki trees.
 You begin with a personal Ki Attack Invent, using 15
 Points as the base instead of whatever is normal for your
 race. This invent begins with the Charging, Counter and
 Remote add-ons for free.
 You may make one non-combo, non-invent Ki attack
 Shield Piercing per round and declare it is SP. At level 6
 this increases to 2 attacks, at level 11, it increases to
 three. Making a multiattack shield piercing counts as two
 uses for that round.
 Mentalist
 You're constantly in tune with the world around you and are
 more acutely aware of the Ki inherent in all living things
 nearby. You know how much there is, and how to manipulate
 it for your own gain.
 Effects:
 +2 Ki Modifier.
 +3 to Ki Strikes.
 +level x 10 to Ki damage.
 Up to once per action, whenever you use a Power from the
 Powering Up tree to recover Ki, except Megacharge, you
 charge double the normal amount of Ki.
 Up to once per action, whenever you use a Power from the
 Powering Up tree to charge into an attack, you charge an
 additional Level*10 damage.
 Charging does not cost you Endurance. Whenever you use
 a Powering Up power you may also use the Powers Rest
 or Rejuvination in the same APR. This only benefits
 Powering Up powers that cost APR to use.
 Androids instead gain a +level x 5 bonus to their Ki
 regeneration.
Powerful Ki User
 You have a lot of Ki, and you use it to overwhelm your
 opponents. Your aura is easily discerned. In combat it's
 almost oppressive.
 Effects:
 +2 Ki Modifier.
 Your racial per-level bonus to Ki is increased by +25.
 All ki attacks gain a damage bonus of 10 for every max
 100 ki you have, which is not affected by charging. When
 using this additional damage, declare PKU in your
 initiative. All your ki attacks cost an extra level*10 ki when
 using this damage bonus. This does not apply for
 Enlarged Ki Blast or Superior Enlarged Ki Blast. If your
 race naturally gains a bonus to damage from Max Ki or
 Max HP, like Ki/25, hp/25 or similar, this unique simply
 replaces it - they do not stack.
 An unlimited number of times per round, you may remote
 any offensive ki powers that miss its target once each, for
 an additional chance at striking your target. Remoting in
 this way costs half of the original attacks ki cost, you can
 not use superspeeds but it does gain a free +3 strike
 bonus. Against this second attempt they must re-declare
 their defense, as though it were against another attack.
 This means that if they used a superspeed or power with a
 per-round limit, they are considered to have used it for this
 round. If the attack was parried back at you, you are only
 allowed to remote it away.
 Telekinetic Powers, Racial powers, Invents, Master Ki
 Combo and the Brutal Fighting Style special attack
 "Concussion Strike" can not be remoted.
 Wild Ki
 Cost Template: [(Ki attack damage + mods) + ( max ki / 100
 x 10 )]
 Psionicist
 You are especially skilled with using your mind in combat.
 You know how to alter reality around yourself with nothing
 but force of will, making it bend and twist as you desire and
 enhancing your attacks.
 Effects:
 +2 to all Strikes and Dodges.
 +Level x 5 to all Damage rolls, including Telekinetics.
 Your Psionic Aura has MNT4 HP and when upgraded to
 Solid Aura, it instead has MNT6 HP.
 The Ki cost for Super Telekinesis and Psionic
 Entemperment is 15 Ki/level.
 The Ki cost to create a blade via Ki Shaping is reduced to
 15 Ki/level, while the cost to swing it is reduced to 5
 Ki/level.
 The Ki cost of Capture Ball is 15ki + 15 Ki per 3 levels.
 Freeze only costs 100 Ki and is usable once every two
 rounds (1/2) instead of once per battle.
 You may use MNT in place of STR for your HtH / Sword
 Damage Modifier.
 Making Super Telekinesis SP does not cost any extra Ki,
 and may be done two additional times per round.
 Psionic Entemperment and Ki Shaping become IA.
 When you successfully Grab someone, you may replace
 the Grapple effect with automatically placing them in a
 Capture Ball by spending Capture Ball's Ki cost and UPR.
 This must be declared as a Capture-Grab when it is used.
 This consumes one UPR from both Grab and Capture
 Ball.
 Androids gain nothing from this unique.
 Relentless Chi
 Your energy attacks are never ending and cut your opponents
 deep, piercing right through defenses.
 +2 Ki Modifier.
 +1 to Ki Strikes.
 All of your ki powers and ki invents may be considered
 Armor Piercing, at your option.
 You are able to use the ability slicing blast three times per
 round.
 Your energy is powerful but unwieldy. You've never fully been
 able to take control of it and you aren't entirely sure if you
 even could. But it doesn't matter. You'll only ever need to
 guide it in the right direction and it'll destroy the rest- Erm.
 Do the rest.
 Effects:
 +2 Ki Modifier.-2 to all Ki strikes.
 +20% Damage increase with Ki attacks.
 When you are hit below 30% of your normal, maximum
 Hit Points, your energy explodes and you gain the
 following benefits:
 +4 to all Ki strikes, which replaces the above.
 +50% damage with all Ki attacks, which replaces the
 above.
 The first time you activate this benefit in the battle you
 gain a Reflexive Shield with your MNT*4 HP from the
 force of your Ki. This Shield may stop SP attacks.
 If you go above 50% of your Maximum HP then you are
 forced to deactivate Wild Ki and you lose these bonuses,
 reverting back to your pre-30% mode.
 Once these bonuses activate, you fight to the end. You fight
 until you've defeated your opponent(s), they give up or you
 are unconscious. You may only choose to surrender if you
 are put under 10% HP. If you go above 50% of your
 Maximum HP this is also removed.

Brutal Fighting Style
 Personality Uniques
 Avenger
 You have a very strong resolve when it comes to championing
 your cause. Whatever it is, your blood boils when facing
 people who are your opposite.
 Effects:
 To take this unique, you must adhere strongly to one of the
 five paths (Order, Chaos, Mercy, Retribution, or Balance)
 as one of its champions.
 Mercy is oppossed to Retribution and Order is oppossed
 to Chaos. Balance has no opposite. Pathless counts as a
 "different path," but is opposite to none.
 You gain +2 to strike/dodge.
 You gain +level x 5 to damage of all types.
 You begin play with Ki sense and Sense Path
 You also have a special ki sense power; no one may hide
 their alignment from you unless they are an Android,
 Sorcerer or have Enhanced Awareness. However, if you
 can't sense their powerlevel this power does not give you
 the power to sense it. When you roll, simply state 'auto
 alignment' so everyone responds with their alignment.
 This does not allow you to gain a lock on anyone hiding
 their powerlevel from you.
 When fighting a character you sense as following a
 different path, except for your opposite, you gain the
 following benefits against that character:
 An additional +1 to strike/dodge
 Your opponent does not count a natural 20 as a critical
 when attacking you, but they are still an auto-hit or auto
defend as appropriate.
 When fighting a character you sense as following the path
 oppossed to your own, you gain the following benefits against
 that character:
 Table of
 Contents20
 An additional +2 to strike/dodge
 You have an additional +level x 5 to all types of damage
 If you receive a level 1 critical from someone from an
 oppossed path, it is negated. If you receive a level 2 or
 level 3 critical from someone from an oppossed path, use
 the same d100 result on the chart one level lower.
 Once per battle, if you were damaged by someone with an
 oppossed path since your last action, you spend a turn
 reciting your creed and steeling your resolve. This
 restores Level50 HP and Ki, and Level2 END. Once you
 take this action nominate one opponent with an opposite
 alignment. You may not surrender, you may not flee, and
 you must pursue that person's defeat to the best of your
 ability. This restriction is lifted if you are knocked
 unconcious.
 Notes:
 Since Androids can't sense people's paths, this unique is
 of dubious benefit to them at best.
 You fight to win and you don't care about the rules. Combat
 etiquette is only there to make the weak feel better about
 their situation or to draw it out for other peoples
 entertainment. They call it fighting dirty, you call it fighting
 smart.
 Effects:
 +2 to all strike and initiative rolls.
 When rolling a Strike or Parry, treat a natural 19 as if you
 had rolled a natural 20.
 Whenever you crit, you can choose to roll the 1d100 for
 the critical effect twice and pick which of the two results
 you want to use.
 *You are able to use the following two attacks once every
 two rounds each.
 Fierce Strike: You release relentless power behind a single
 attack, greatly increasing your normal damage by gnarling
 your fist and using your fingers to act like knuckle dusters.
 This add-on modifies any basic attack or the basic discharge
 power. It becomes AC, using the Sharp Critical Hit Chart
 regardless of the actual attack. This critical may not by
 stopped by Advanced Block, but an Advanced Block will
 prevent it from advancing to DAC through a roll of 19 or 20
 on the strike.
 Concussion Strike: You launch an attack at your opponents
 head! Or another weakpoint. This is a basic attack that deals
 1d8 UP/IA damage per level. It has a -5 penalty to strike, but
 may not be parried. If the attack deals damage, then the
 target is stunned for their next two actions. Until this stun
 ends the target may not parry and is at a -5 penalty to dodge
 rolls.
 Templates Fierce: {Base Damage + Stat Mod + Misc
 Damage + Bulk or PKU} Sharp AC Concussion Strike: {1d8
 per level + Stat Mod + Misc Mods + Bulk or PKU} Stunned
 for 2 actions, during which you may not parry and receive a -5
 penalty to strike.
Focused
 Your concentration is unbreakable. You will fight entire
 battles waiting for that one, perfect moment. And you know
 just what to do when it comes.
 Effects:
 +3 to all Strikes and Dodges.
 Your base invent points are 5 higher than normal. This
 stacks with any racial features which increase your invent
 points as well as inreasing any free invents given by racial
 features or powers unless otherwise stated.
 You can declare "Focused" as an addon to spend up to
 your level in Endurance and add an equal amount of
 +Strike or +Dodge to the roll. This bonus can be used
 alongside Superspeeds and other bonuses and can even
 apply to Telekinetics. This bonus can be used once per
 round, at level 12 you may use it twice per round.
 Notes:
 If you use focus on an attack and then use the Super
 Speed power Zanzoken or the Unique Power Reflection,
 you still gain the bonus from Focus. However it disappears
 if you use remote or double remote (you may also save it
 to use on those add-ons to Ki Attacks instead of your
 initial attack).
 Quick Learner
 You might not be the smartest person, but you are the fastest
 to pick up what you don't know. It makes you able to adapt
 and diversify to situations easier, and makes you a better
 fighter overall. More importantly, the more you fight someone
 the more you predict their movements.
 Effects:
 You gain an additional power every level up.
 You gain an additional free school at creation that doesn't
 count against your INT/10 maximum.
 You gain an additional free school at level 11 that doesn't
 count against your INT/10 maximum.
 Regular schools take one less day to learn, meaning they
 take 3 Neo weeks (3 OOC days) instead of 4.
 You only take 1 Neo Week (1 OOC day) to learn any racial
 power or personal school.
 You gain an additional EXP bonus from all fights,
 depending on the outcome. The bonus is +10/+15/+20
 EXP for a win/draw/loss.
 Superiority Complex
 You're an arrogant bastard and everybody knows it. But it's
 not your fault, really. You're just better than they are.
 Effects:
 You gain a +4 bonus to all Strikes, Dodges and Initiative
 rolls, as well as +level x 5 bonus to all types of damage as
 long as you're above 50% HP. As soon as you're knocked
 below 50% HP, you lose these benefits and you can not
 regain them even if your HP increases past 50% later on
 in the battle.
 Seperate of the above, if you're fighting outnumbered in a
 team battle, you gain a +2 to all Strikes and Dodges for
 each additional opponent the opposing team has over
 yours.
 If you survive a fight where you're outnumbered in a team
 battle from the start, you gain an additional 100 EXP.
 Additional allies joining in to even things out negates this
 bonus. Downed enemies still "count" as being on the other
 team.
 If your opponent activates a Superform or Statbooster
 before you do, activating yours costs you no Endurance
 and any EXP penalty associated with it is halved.
 Tactician
 In and out of combat, you calculate. Always. You don't have to
 sit there and think about things, you're always adjusting and
 estimating your calculations without the need for a pause. It's
 very hard to suprise or shock you with anything these days.
 Effects:
 +1 Initiative every odd level (1, 3, 5, 7).
 You gain +INT/25 to your APR instead of INT/30.
 You can sacrifice one of your APR as a preround action to
 study your opponent. When you do this, you gain +3 to all
 Strikes, Dodges and Initiative for that round.
 You may also spend up to your level in actions per battle to
 study the combat. Each action spent this way grants you a
 +2 to any Strike or Dodge roll you desire later on. You can
 not sacrifice actions preround to gain this bonus, you
 must spend your actions as they come up in the round to
 gain it. You can spend the bonus you gain in any way you'd
 like; dividing up these bonuses as you see fit to any actions
 you want for the rest of the battle, but must state how
 large of a bonus you're using on any given action when
 declared.
 You may spend actions studying your opponent if you are
 stunned, grappled, in a capture ball or would otherwise
 have your actions limited. Except being unconcious or
 dead--even you can't study things at that point.

Trance Form
 You know how to fight and how to fight well, but you don't like
 to always channel that part of yourself. There's something
 about it, something dangerous and mysterious that makes
 you shy away from it. But when you embrace it.. It feels good!
 Effects:
 Table of
 Contents
 This unique has no effect normally. However when you're
 knocked below 50% of your Maximum HP, you cam
 choose to activate a mini-Superform, which grants you a
 +4 bonus to all Strikes, Dodges and Initiative rolls for the
 rest of the battle. In addition, you gain 50% of your
 Maximum Ki back (100% if you are an Android) and 100%
 of your maximum endurance into their own 'Trance Pool',
 which are then consumed before your normal pools are.
 Once you transform, you fight to the end. You fight until
 you've defeated your opponent(s), they give up or you are
 unconscious. You may however surrender if you are under
 10% HP.
 When dropped below 50%, this transformation is optional
 and not automatic. You can choose to activate Trance
 instantly when you drop below 50% HP or you can
 activate it at a later stage by using an action to do so.
 Notes:
 The +50% Ki has its own pool as mentioned, like your
 MegaCharge Pool does. So you'd have your 'normal Ki
 Pool', your 'Charging Ki Pool', your 'Megacharge Ki Pool'
 and your 'Trance Ki pool'.
 Trance does not count as a Superform and may be used
 with Statboosters/Superforms as normal.
 Androids gain nothing from the Endurance recovery
 aspect of this unique.
 LEAVE MY Piccolo!
 DADDY ALONE!
 Very Calm
 You're not really a fan of hurting people and you try to shy
 away from excessively violent combat. You try to reason with
 people and show them the error of their ways, but even you
 have a breaking point. And when it breaks.. They will know to
 listen next time.
 Effects:
 +3 to all Dodges and Parries.
 +1 APR.
 When you are hit below 30% of your normal maximum Hit
 Points you gain the following benefits, replacing the
 above:
 +4 to all Strikes.
 +4 to all Initiative rolls.
 +3 APR.
 +15 x Level to all damages.
 You lose these benefits if you raise above 50% HP.
 Once these bonuses activate, you fight to the end. You fight
 until you've defeated your opponent(s), they give up or you
 are unconscious. You may only choose to surrender if you
 are put under 10% HP. If you go above 50% of your
 Maximum HP this is also removed.
 The bonus damage stacks with Bulk/PKU but works the
 same way as those two powers. This means the damage only
 applies to the last strike in a combo, its never multiplied by
 percentage mods such as Berserker/Wild Ki/Damaging Aura,
 and it does not affect Grapple moves. It does, however, affect
 Perfect Strike but it goes after the 2 multiplier.

Blur
 Survival Uniques
 Alternate Understanding
 Your mind works to understand the nuances of combat only
 to make yourself more of a stalwart. Your energy is best used
 defensively, and your training has made use of that fact.
 Effects:
 +2 Ki Modifier.
 Begin with two powes from the Defensive Ki or
 Telekinetics Tree.
 Your Ki Shield has MNT x 15 HP.
 Your Ki Shield regenerates your MNT on each of your
 actions.
 Your Ki Shield ignores Armor Piercing.
 You may use all non-Invent auras and shields as if you
 were two levels higher than you actually are.
 All your Shield Invents automatically have the Reflexive
 add-on for free and using a Shield Invent reflexively does
 not increase the ki cost.
 You begin with a Shield Invent with a base of 20 invent
 points instead of the normal 30. This is not increased by
 racial features or other uniques. This invent shield may be
 used once per round rather than the standard once per 2
 rounds.
 Using invent shields in combat cost you half experience
 negatives.
 Blinding Celerity
 You're exceptionally fast, and seem to be able to move and
 react quicker than anyone else. You're always a half second
 ahead of those around you, which is often suprising when you
 interject between their attacks.
 Effects:
 Your APR calculation uses SPD/20, rather than SPD/25.
 +2 to all Strikes and Dodges.
 You may freely move up to two of your actions to wherever
 you want in the round, however you can not move them in
 front of your opponent's first action.
 Your Flight Multiplier gets a +5 bonus. And get an
 additional +1 bonus to your Flight Multiplier every other
 level, starting at level 3 (3, 5, 7, 9, etc)
 Notes:
 If you win initiative, you can choose to move your first
 action behind your opponents first.
 When multiple people with BC are fighting, the person
 with the lowest initiative moves his two actions where he
 wants first, followed then the highest. This must be done
 before anyone acts in the round and you can not move
 your actions up before your opponent's first action. This
 may only be done pre-round, and you should announce its
 use in your initiative roll.
 In any fight where there's more than two people fighting;
 all players with this unique declare the use of BC and
 move their last action of the round to the front of the
 round, right behind the person who wins initiative. This
 option replaces the normal option for moving two actions
 and you must choose to do this before the first person
 acts.
 When you want to be, you can be fast. Really fast. An
 impossible blur of motion, even.
 Effects:
 +1 APR
 You gain +2 Strike and +2 Dodge
 You begin play with the advanced flight power.
 Combat Teleport and Advanced Combat Teleport have no
 ki costs for you.
 You are able to use the Multi Combat Teleport (MCT)
 power twice per round.
 When calculating your bonus from a Superspeed which
 uses your SPD score (MCT, MACT, Zanzo, Shadow
 School Invent, etc), your Speed score is considered to be
 20% higher than it actually is. This does not affect
 Graceful.
 Immortal
 You are ageless. It could be a curse placed on you by some
 mystic being or just the incredibly long lifespan your people
 have, but you always come back. Eventually, anyway.
 Effects:
 +2 Hp Modifier.
 Per-level racial HP bonus is increased by +25.
 You regenerate (1+(Level/8)) Endurance on each of your
 actions.
 Androids regenerate +Level x 5 Ki instead of any
 endurance.
 You regenerate Level x 5 HP or Level x P back on each of
 your actions.
 You have a number of Sub-LP equal to your level200, or
 your existing Sub-LP is increased by Level200.
 Criticals that are normal instant death for you instead
 can't kill you. A lost head instead counts as a level three
 critical on every other part of your body.
 Once per 2 rounds you may take an action activate this
 unique. Until the beginning of your next action you may
 not be reduced below 1 HP and you negate any criticals
 inflicted.
 You recover from injuries at an accellerated rate: Criticals:
 3 RL Hours Double Criticals: 12 RL Hours Triple Criticals
 or removed limb: 24 RL Hours.

 You gain an additional natural Resistance of STM/2
 (Androids use STR/2 instead).
 Any Armor Ignore and Armor Shattering effects are
 reduced to Armor Piercing against you. AP attacks still act
 as normal.
 Once per 2 rounds you may spend 2 End to perform a
 Brick Block against an incoming attack. This is a block
 that divides the incoming damage by /3 instead of /2 and
 doubles your Resistance. You may not use any form of
 aura or shield with Brick Block.
 Naturally Lucky
 You're character has a large ammount of luck on his side and
 you know how to wield it.
 Effects:
 Table of

 You gain +1 Strike and Dodge
 The credits you gain at creation and the 100 credits you
 gain every day are doubled.
 Any time you roll a 1 on a strike/dodge treat it the same as
 if you had rolled a natural 20.
 You can reroll any strike or dodge roll up to 1+level/6
 times per round. This ability may be used with parries.
 You keep all bonuses and powers you had with the original
 roll without repaying any costs - you just reroll the d20.
 This also means the defender does not redeclare their
 defense. You can not use this power twice on the same
 attack or defense. When applied to a multi sword attack,
 this only lets you reroll one of the strikes rather than all of
 them.
 You may spend a reroll on a failed dodge or parry to
 reflexively block.
 Will to Power
 Your determination is your strength and you especially make
 it so. You're hard to weaken and even harder to keep that way.
 Your spirit will not be denied.
 Effects:
 +2 Ki Modifier.
 +level x 5 Ki Regeneration.
 You have a special shield with (STM+MNT)2 HP. This
 shield can block SP and even UP attacks and can be used
 reflexively. This shield can even regenerate; recovering
 level5 HP each action in combat. Out of combat, it
 recovers its HP the same rate you recover your Ki.
 Up to (level/2) times per round, you can make the
 Defensive Ki powers 'Aura of Protection' and 'Supreme
 Aura' have the effect of Flaring, at no additional ki cost.
 This flaring returns 20% of damage shielded by your aura
 to the attacker. This method can reflect all forms of
 attacks, even if it does not stop it. When you flare a ki
 attack in this way the damage returned is only 10%. The
 flared damage is UP / AS. In the case of Multislashes and
 Combos, one activation of this power covers only one of
 the damage rolls.
 Additionally, you can use your special shield to force
 someone off of you, making it explode if someone is
 grappling you. You use the shield's current HP as your
 strength and roll a break grapple as normal. This depletes
 the shield of all its HP.
 Note:
 Android's shield has (STR+MNT)*2 HP instead of the
 norm.

 eoDBZ is, ultimately, a game based around
 combat. It is typically the easiest way to
 gain experience and it is essential to learn
 if you're going to play this game. Though
 not required. It should be noted that most
 events involve more advanced forms of
 combat; so it's recommended at least some
 form of knowledge on the combat system be known.
 *Note: The rules in this section of the phb are standized. If
 a power, ability, racial trait or unique suggestions that it
 functions in an alternative method to the ruling in this
 section, presume the abnormal ruling is correct. The combat
 part of the PHB is intended to be a 'catch all', but some
 special abilities have their own special rulings.

Basic Combat
 1. Initiative
 When two people square off the exact timing of actions
 becomes important.
 The first thing you do in combat, is roll your combat
 Initiative to determine the order of your actions so you can
 beat on one another. You should be able to find your
 Inititative roller in your character sheet and fill it in as
 required, but there's a few additional tidbits of information
 you can add; more information for your opponent, the better.
 Preround Declarations: In short; anything that you activate
 as a passive ability or power, is considered a "Preround"
 power. If you paid for Bulking Aura and want to add it to your
 damage, you add it to the list of Prerounds. Same with Basic
 Flight, Weighted Clothes, if you're attempting to Ki sense
 lock.
 To make things quicker, you can also consider adding your
 Alignment to hasten combat by removing the need of having
 to exchange the information each time. Anything that
 provides important information to your opponent speeds
 things up, even if your Declarations start becoming a long
 list.
 The normal format in your character sheet should
 something like this:
 <br>Initiative: {1d20+(INT/5+SPD/25)} | APR:
 [INT/30+DEX/35+SPD/25] | SPD: #<br>Preround
 Declarations: Basic Flight. Weighted Clothes 1. Ki Sense:
 Auto. Neutral Good.
 When this is posted, it will roll the 1d20 and you'll have
 your initiative number. Divide the rolled initiative by your
 calculated APR to get a division. Using this new number, you
 reduce your initiative number repeatedly to get a series of
 numbers up to your APR.
 For example; Goku rolls 20 and has 5 APR, whereas
 Freiza rolls 15 and has 7 APR. 20/5 is 4. So thats 20 16 12 8
 4 for Goku's Initiative. Freiza rolled 15 and has 7 APR, 15/7
 is 2; which means his init looks like 15 13 11 9 7 5 3. Now
 since these numbers are meaningless as they are, they're
 converted to the characters initial to make: GG FF G FF G
 FF G F.
 Remember, your APR stats are a minimium of 1 for each. If
 you have 20 INT, 20/30 = 1. So your minimium APR is 3.
 The reason your Speed stat is listed is because during a
 Tie; the faster fighter goes first.
 2. Acting in the Round
 When taking your actions, it's important that you actually
 roleplay out your actions and follow them with a brief Out Of
 Character explanation of what you're doing. For example:
 Arvok smirks, his aura flaring slightly as he does so.
 Seconds pass, and his aura begins to grow massively,
 collecting ki at an alarming rate! When his aura dims, his
 powerlevel has grown substantially. (Mega Charge)
 In the above, Arvok roleplayed his action, and declared
 what power he was doing. You must declare what you're
 using, if he had not declared Mega Charge, his opponent
 wouldn't know if he used Charge, Enhanced Charge, High
 Charge, or Megacharge, amongst other things.
 The amount of depth you use with each post will vary, but
 it's recommended by the GM's that your fights consist of
 more detailed roleplay than:
 Goku laughs as he's hit. (Power Block) Vegeta pummels
 you! (ACT Combo) Freiza fires a beam of Ki! (MACT Piercing
 Blast)
 This makes for boring fights not only for spectators; but for
 you and your opponent.
 When it's your turn to act, you can do many things.
 Everyone can perform certain actions, which are listed in this
 chapter in the node 'Basic Attacks'. Aside from these attacks,
 you can perform different attacks based upon the powers you
 have and for this reason it is important to pick powers wisely
 to ensure you can do what you want to do in combat. All
 actions cost at least one point of Endurance (End) and some
 cost more than one.
 If they do not state how much Endurance they cost, then
 they simply cost one point.
 When you attack someone (or when you're attacked), you
 then have to post a defensive reaction. The most common
 methods of defense are Blocking (letting them hit you, but
 absorbing some of the impact to take less than the full
 damage), Dodging (to try and avoid the attack altogether) and
 Parrying (Similar to Dodging, but you're only trying to
 redirect their attack away from you using your hands or a
 weapon).
 An example exception to the above rule of every action
 costing one Endurance is Blocking and Dodging.
 Parrying has an Endurance cost listed with the type of
 Parrying power you're using, which means parry cannot be
 used before you buy the power.
 Example of an Attack and corresponding Defense is thus:
 Goku launched off of the stone pillar toward the Saiyan
 invader, blurring out of sight at the last instant to strike
 Vegeta's cheek from the left side with a clenched fist, sending
 him spinning toward the ground. (ACT Power Punch)
 Vegeta smirked as the weakling warrior tried to catch him
 off-guard, jerking his body back as Goku's fist headed toward
 his face. His hand slapped Goku's forearm, forcing it away
 from his cheek while pushing him to throw him off balance.
 (ACT Parry)
 Goku then rolls his Strike roll; he rolled a 34. Vegeta then
 rolls his Parry roll, he only rolled a 29 so he got hit.
 There are several things Vegeta could do in this situation, if
 his speed were higher, he could use the power Zanzoken to
 reroll his Parry (if he also had access to the power), but his
 speed isn't high enough. He could use the Telekinetic power
 Freeze, but he doesn't feel like Goku's punch is that strong
 and so he takes the damage.
Goku rolls and ends up dealing 384 points of AP/SP damage
 to Vegeta. Vegeta is level 6, so he decides to use the power
 Supreme Aura to reduce the damage by 150; determined by
 the maximium the power allows for his level. He then shows
 his damage calculation:
 [384-150-24] => 210
 The -24 is from his Racial Resistance. Check your racial
 information for your own resistance.
 So he takes 210 points of damage and marks down that he
 spent 150 Ki using Supreme Aura, in addition to spending 30
 Ki for using ACT with his Parry along with the endurance for
 using the actual parry power. This comes to 2 Endurance,
 180 Ki in total. Goku only spent 1 Endurance and 30 Ki;
 which means if they kept up this kind of exchange, Goku
 could win.
 You always show damage reductions publicly when you
 reduce the damage from any attack. This keeps everyone
 honest, and helps everyone correct any mistakes someone
 makes.
 Now you know the basics of combat; Rolling Initiative and
 working out your combat order, basic attack and damage
 along with defenses. You can effectively start playing right
 away. However there are more advanced powers, abilities,
 status effects and more if you want to compete to be the best.
 1. Attacking
 Perhaps the most common thing you'll be doing is Attacking
 your opponent to make them kneel under pressure. There's
 three basic ways of attacking someone:
 With a Hand to Hand attack, a Sword (weapon) attack or a
 Ki attack. In every case, every attack can be placed into one
 of these three categories.
 Hand to Hand attacks are the simplest to do and every
 fighter in NeoDBZ knows how to fight this way, to a basic
 degree. Everyone knows how to throw a punch or a kick, but
 not everyone is good at it. The list of attacks everyone can do
 is listed in the Basic Attacks node later in this chapter. Hand
 to Hand attacks use your DEX/5 as your modifier to strike
 and add your STR/5 to damage.
 For example: {(1d6 per level+Str/5)+Misc mods+Bulk}
 Punch, 1 Endurance.
 Sword attacks are very similar to Hand to Hand attacks,
 but could be considered a little bit more complicated.
 Everyone can still pick up a sword and swing it (though, some
 not very well). Everyone knows how to make a 'Basic attack'
 with any weapon they pick up using your DEX/5 to strike. If
 you hit you deal the weapon's base dice in damage, plus your
 level bonus damage dice (which is listed with the weapon
 itself), plus your STR/5, plus all miscellaneous bonuses you
 have to damage.
 For example: {(2d10+1d10 per level+Str/5)+Misc
 mods+Bulk} Light Weapon, 1 Endurance.
 Ki attacks are perhaps the most complex, some fighters
 never learn how to gather their energy and turn it into a blast
 of destructive energy. In order to perform Ki attacks, you
 must get the appropriate power from the Offensive Ki tree 
there is no "Basic" Ki Attack. Ki attacks use your MNT/5 as
 the modifier to Strike and to damage, in addition to the base
 dice of the Ki attack, which varies according to how much Ki
 you spent on it.
 For example: {(5d8 per level+MNT/5)+ Misc mods} Basic
 Discharge; 25 ki cost per level.
 When you attack, you first roll strike which is
 1d20+appropriate Stat modifier+miscellaneous bonuses and
 your opponent declares his defense. If your opponent blocks,
 you can just roll 1d20 to check for a critical you don't need to
 show all of your bonuses, since it's only the d20 result which
 matters.
 You then roll the damage of what you're doing, presuming
 you hit. Powers will have the listed damage.
 However, when taking your actions it's important that you
 actually roleplay out your actions and follow them with a brief
 Out Of Character explanation of what you're doing. For
 example:
 Arvok smirks, his aura flaring slightly as he does so.
 Second pass, and his aura begins to grow massivly, collecting
 ki at an alarming rate! When his aura dims, his powerlevel
 has grown substantially. (Mega Charge)
 In the above, Arvok roleplayed his action and declared
 what power he was doing. You must declare what you're
 using, if he had not declared Mega Charge, his opponent
 wouldn't know if he used Charge, Enhanced Charge, High
 Charge or Megacharge, amongst other things.
 Remember that when you use addons such as Bulks,
 Superspeeds and so on. Anything that alters your attack's
 damage, speed or adds additional status effects is an addon.
 The amount of depth you use with each post will vary, but
 it's recommended by the GM's that your fights consist of
 more detailed roleplay than:
 Goku laughs as he's hit. (Power Block) Vegeta pummels
 you! (ACT Combo) Freiza fires a beam of Ki! (MACT Piercing
 Blast)
 This makes for boring fights not only for spectators; but for
 you and your opponent.
 When it's your turn to act, you can do many things.
 Everyone can perform certain actions, which are listed in this
 chapter in the node 'Basic Attacks'. Aside from these attacks,
 you can perform different attacks based upon the powers you
 have and for this reason it is important to pick powers wisely
 to ensure you can do what you want to do in combat. All
 actions cost at least one point of Endurance (End) and some
 cost more than one.
 If they do not state how much Endurance they cost, then
 they simply cost one point.
 When you attack someone (or when you're attacked), you
 then have to post a defensive reaction. The most common
 methods of defense are Blocking (letting them hit you, but
 absorbing some of the impact to take less than the full
 damage), Dodging (to try and avoid the attack altogether) and
 Parrying (Similar to Dodging, but you're only trying to
 redirect their attack away from you using your hands or a
 weapon).
 Example of an Attack is thus: Goku launched off of the
 stone pillar toward the Saiyan invader, blurring out of sight at
 the last instant to strike Vegeta's cheek from the left side with
 a clenched fist, sending him spinning toward the ground.
 (ACT Power Punch)
1. Defense
 When you're attacked, you almost always have the chance to
 defend yourself. You roleplay out your defensive action and
 state in parenthesis what defensive action you're taking.
 Dodging is a defensive action anyone can do. It costs you
 nothing to do and is just a simple attempt to get out of the
 way of an attack. You roll 1d20+SPD/5+miscellaneous dodge
 modifiers, in response to their attack. If the result is the same
 or higher than theirs, you've successfully dodged. If your
 result is lower, they hit you before you can move out of the
 way and you're hit full force.
 Blocking is also a defensive action which almost everyone
 can do, but it requires the power Block from the Defensive
 power Tree to perform. When you block, you allow your
 opponent to hit you, but you take less than the full amount of
 damage. In most cases, you divide the total damage by two, if
 Blocking does something different for you, the power will say
 so.
 Parrying is another option you can do and like Blocking,
 requires you to have a specific power to do so. To parry with
 your bare hands, you must have the HtH Parry power from
 the Hand to Hand tree, if you want to parry with a weapon,
 you must have the Parrying Strike power from the Sword
 tree. If you want to parry with your mind, you must have the
 Telekinetic Parry power from the Telekinetic tree.
 Normally, the only type of defense which has a cost
 associated with it is Parrying, which has its cost listed in the
 appropriate power tree. Higher forms of Blocking (like Power
 Block) might have you spend Ki to reduce the damage before
 you divide it by two, in which case you incur a cost based on
 how much you reduce the damage by.
 2. Damage Reduction
 The order in which you reduce damage is always as follows:
 1) Auras / Shields Various Auras and Shields are available
 to every fighter, the most common of which are included in
 the Defensive Ki power tree. All share a common theme:
 Reducing an attack's force by spending Ki. While they are the
 most common, they are not the only things capable of helping
 you take less damage, Psionic and Solid Aura from the
 Telekinetic power tree are also common methods of defense.
 Multiple auras and shields can not be used together unless
 the power specifically says so and if someone attacks you
 with a Combo power (doing multiple, different attacks at the
 same time), you can only use a specific Aura or Shield against
 one of the attacks, you couldn't use the same Shield against
 all of the attacks in the combo.
 For example; If you got hit by a combo which involved Multi
 Punch and then Power Punch, you would not be able to use
 an SP shield on both attacks, but you could use Aura of
 Protection against the Multi Punch and Supreme Aura
 against the Power Punch.
 Shields and Auras which have a Ki cost can be scaled to
 your desired effect, up to your maximum ability, determined
 by level. Those shields which have no cost (like Ki Shield, and
 Solid aura), can not be used to block out less than the
 maximum amount of damage that they could.
 You do not need to declare which shield you are using
 when you're planning to shield, however you do need to when
 damage reduction takes place, along with the ki cost.
 Shields and Auras may not be used while unconcious
 unless the power specifically states otherwise.
 Template: [(Damage Dealt-Shield or Aura)-Resistance]
 2) Blocking
 A power from the Defensive power tree, blocking allows you
 to brace for the impact of an attack. You're automatically hit,
 but you're able to reduce the damage slightly by preparing for
 it. Blocking divides the damage in half.
 You must declare you are blocking and which block power
 you're using in order to utilize it.
 Template: [(Damage Dealt/2)-Resistance]
 3) Armor
 If you're wearing armor, the armor is subtracted from the
 damage immediately after the aura. The damage reduction is
 applied before blocking. Certain things can reduce the
 effectiveness of Armor or ignore it entirely, be sure to read
 anything listed beside the damage dealt.
 This step also includes any form of Natural Armor a
 character might have, some races have a certain amount of
 Natural Armor, which is treated the exact same way as
 regular Armor. Anything that pierces regular armor also
 pierces Natural Armor. If you have a form of Natural Armor,
 you can not wear Armor on top of it.
 Armor must be declared in your Initiative preround in
 order to be worn in combat and may not be added during an
 ongoing battle with exception of Natural Armor - which must
 always be 'worn' and applied.
 Template: [(Damage Dealt - Aura - Armor) - Resistance]
 Blocking Template: [(Damage Dealt - Aura - Armor)/2 
Resistance]
4) Resistance
 Resistance is the last form of damage reduction. Resistance
 ensures that whatever force gets past your auras, blocking
 and armor, it then doesn't do you much damage. Hopefully.
 The most common form of Resistance is given to you by your
 Racial Resistance found in your Race's information, but there
 are certain uniques and powers which grant some fighters
 additional Resistance as well.
 Resistance acts much like Armor in that it reduces an
 attack's damage before it's dealt to your Hit Points, except
 that it doesn't diminish. Things which bypass or reduce any
 Armor you're wearing also bypass Resistance, unless stated
 otherwise.
 Multiple sources of resistance stack; So if you had level4
 resistance from your race and 5level from a racial power or
 unique, you would have level*9 resistance in total.
 Unlike other forms of damage reduction; resistance always
 applies even when unconcious.
 Template: [(Damage Dealt - Resistance)]
 Example:
 Goku struck Vegeta in combat for a 400-damage punch and
 Vegeta used the Defensive powers 'Power Block' and 'Aura of
 Protection'. Assume for this example he has no Armor worn
 or that it is broken.
 Step 1: Auras and Shields [400-200] = 200 Damage left
 (200 was reduced by Aura of Protection, costing Vegeta 100
 Ki) Step 2: Armor He isn't wearing any armor or it is broken,
 so this step is skipped. Step 3: Blocking [200/2] = 100
 Blocking reduces the damage by half. Step 4: Resistance
 [100-48] = 52 (Vegeta is level 12 and has 4*level resistance)
 Vegeta then takes 50 points of damage.
 Normally these steps are put together as a single reduction
 calculation in combat, in which case it would look like this:
 [(400-200)/2-48] = 52 AoP. 100 ki.
 Or: [(Damage Dealt - Shield or Aura - Armor)/2 
Resistance]
 1. Health and Energy
 Everyone has Hit Points, Life Points, Ki and Endurance. The
 exception to this is Androids, which have no Endurance and
 is detailled in their racial information. While there is no
 direct penalty to losing Ki, Hit Points or Endurance, common
 sense would dictate that if you're at half Hit Points, then your
 character looks beaten up. Same with being at Half
 endurance, you might be sweating or breathing heavily from
 fatigue. Ki is a little bit less noticeable in terms of how much
 you have versus how much you're missing, though it would
 still be indicated in your powerlevel lowering and maybe
 similar to exhaustion or fatigue, but in a more spiritual way in
 place of physical exertion.
 You do not regen while there is an ongoing fight in your
 scene. Even if you're not part of it.
 Hit Points (HP)
 These points represent how much damage you can take and
 should be considered superficial injury, such as bruises and
 more minor cuts that won't have lasting impact on the body's
 performance. When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points, you go
 unconscious. If someone deals you damage beyond this, the
 damage then goes to your Life Points. You recover 5% of your
 Maximum Hit Points every Neo hour (7 IRL minutes) out of
 combat. You do not regain HP while a fight is ongoing in the
 scene that you're in.
 Ki (Chi)
 These points represent your spiritual energy. How much you
 have and how well you can use it. You spend it to enhance the
 stength and speed of your attacks, as well as to reduce the
 damage you take and more. You recover 5% of your
 Maximum Ki every Neo hour (7 IRL minutes) out of combat.
 You do not regain Ki while a fight is ongoing in the scene that
 you're in.
 Life Points (LP)
 These represent the natural resilience of your body to survive
 without any conscious aid from you. If you run out of Hit
 Points, damage then goes to your Life Points. Generally
 speaking, Life Points are serious damage to the body; such as
 internal bleeding and damaged organs or worse. If you then
 lose all of your Life points, you are dead. If your Life Points
 are ever damaged, you must recover them fully before you
 start to recover any of your Hit Points. Life Points recover
 slowly at a rate of (Level*2 LP) every hour in-game (7 IRL
 minutes).
 If you recieve a heal while unconcious, the healing power
 will specify if it is LP or HP or both. If it's for a HP heal while
 you're in LP; you gain it as normal but must continue to
 regain your LP through natural regen before waking up. If
 the heal would wake you up due to being restored, you will
 still remain unconcious for half the regen time it would've
 normally taken.
 For example; if you were KO'd by an attack that takes you
 into 100 LP's, (-100 HP) and you were level 5, you would take
 70 Real Life minutes to wake up. You continue to regenerate
 HP as normal during this time. You do not regain LP while a
 fight is ongoing in the scene that you're in.
Sub-Life Points (SLP)
 These life points are a rare form of additional Life Points that
 represent a characters ability to survive even beyond what
 most consider death. While in Sub-LP, you give off no power
 level or pulse as if you were dead and cannot be targetted for
 additional damage or a killing move while in this state. Even
 if someone does try; simply pretend to take the damage or
 state you're dead. Once you're back to 1 LP, you once more
 have a pulse and power level. You must regenerate Sub-LP
 before you can begin regenerating LP.
 Warning; you can be killed if sufficient damage puts you
 through your LP and Sub LP in a single attack - only if you
 keep Sub-LP after the damage is finished do you get it as a
 'free death'.
 If a person has witnessed this state of death before, is a
 member of your race with the same death state or has been
 told by someone aware of this state of death (simply sensing
 someone disappear is not enough to confirm these
 suspicions - you would have to be told that person x is infact
 dead 100%), one person present (and aware) can target the
 remains with an attack and only once to try and kill you for
 good. If they fail to deal enough damage to put you to 0 Sub
LP or below, then you are still alive. You do not regain SLP
 while a fight is ongoing in the scene that you're in.
 You regain SLP at double the rate you gain LP, unless
 otherwise stated.
 Endurance (End)
 It determines how physically fit you are and just how long you
 can go on fighting. You pay 1 Endurance for every action you
 take, minimum unless otherwise specified. Certain attacks
 might cost more than one point of End, they will state so in
 their descriptions. When you have 0 Endurance, you have
 over-exerted yourself and you go unconscious. If you were
 performing an action that takes you into negative endurance;
 the action is aborted. You regain 25% of your Maximum
 Endurance every Neo hour (7 IRL minutes).
 You do not regain END while a fight is ongoing in the scene
 that you're in.
 Regeneration
 In combat, it means you recover a certain amount of HP, LP,
 Ki or End (or whatever it is that you regenerate) on each of
 your actions per round. This happens automatically at the
 start of your action (before costs/effects) and happens even
 on actions in which you're stunned and unable to act, unless
 the power used specifically states that it prevents you from
 regenerating.
 If you regenerate at an accelerated rate during combat, you
 will regenerate just as quickly out of combat. You add the
 number you multiply your your level by to find your per-action
 regeneration to the amount of % you heal per Neo Hour. For
 instance, if you regenerate Level6 HP per action, you heal
 +6% of your HP per Neo Hour outside of combat. If you
 regenerate Level3 HP and Level*3 Ki per action, you recover
 +3% HP and Ki every Neo Hour outside of Combat.
 If you recover LP faster than normal, then you add your
 per-action LP regeneration directly to how much LP you
 recover from every Neo Hour. +Level1 LP Regeneration
 causes you to recover +Level1 LP every Neo Hour.
 Unconcious (KO)
 This means you are immediately removed from the Initiative
 and ignored in order to deal with more immediate threats, if
 they are present. If you are KO'd in the middle of an action
 string or Multi Attack involving multiple strike rolls, your
 opponent may cease his attack at any time if he chooses but
 pays the costs of the attacks as normal. Combos can not be
 pulled in this way and full damage must apply, if it hits with
 the exception of Sword Combos; since they function more
 like a Multi.
 The reasoning for not being targettable while unconcious
 during a fight, is simply that fights are so fast; an opponent
 doesn't have the opportunity to look for a small power
 signature and line up an attack before their opponent
 intercepts them.
 You are considered Unconcious when you either:
 1) Run out of HP.
 2) Run out of Endurance.
 3) Run out of Ki, if you're an Android.
 4) Knocked out by a Critical that induces an auto-KO or
 Death.
 Death
 This means you've run out of LP and you're unable to save
 yourself. Consider carefully before declaring death, because
 many times senior players have been able to point out
 methods of preventing an accidental death by better usage of
 Damage Reduction or Special abilities and thus avoiding an
 upset player. It's easy to get upset over death, so ensure you
 have done everything you can in order to prevent it before
 throwing in the towel. Keep your sheet, too. Because in some
 circumstances Death is not the end.
 Remember that passive shields such as Solid Aura and
 Resistance continue to function while you're unconcious, but
 without using an ability that feigns death, someone can still
 tell if you're in positive LP.
 Certain races or Immortals are harder to kill than others,
 but not known by people outside their race or unless they've
 been told by the person or witnessed the ressurection first
 hand. If someone you killed came back to life; you'd be
 suspicious of their next "death" too.
 Feigning Death
 Unfortunately pretending to be dead can be metagamed
 against, so you must be weary about telling people ICly about
 techniques you have or know to avoid dying if you want to live
 a long and happy life. Abilities such as Taisha's Charge taught
 by the Vengard School can make you appear dead to the
 untrained eye and immune to further damage unless the
 person knows how to circumvent the technique by
 possessing it or having seen you use it before.
Armors and Natural Armors
 Sometimes you'll have access to Armors or automatically
 possess Natural Armors. This is generally treated as an
 additional buffer for your health points or life points. Details
 for its usage can be found under the "Defense" node in Basic
 Combat.
 Armors are bought or made and must be declared pre
round to be used; they have an associated XP penalty if used
 outside of serious fights and generally act as additional health
 or damage reduction, sometimes with additional effects.
 Armors tend to warn your opponent you mean business. You
 can only wear one type of Armor at any one time.
 Natural Armors however, are always applied and do not
 need to be declared pre-round. You must apply Natural
 Armors (unless it was destroyed in a previous fight). You may
 not wear Armor over Natural Armor; for example if an Icer
 was wearing Armor and ascended to Form 3 which gains
 Natural Armor - the Armor is simply forced off his body by
 the natural one and drops to the floor.
 Donning Armor may only be done as a pre-round action in
 the initial initiative roll, you cannot suddenly decide to apply
 Armor in later initiatives, unless the fight ends and a new one
 begins. Natural Armors regenerate as explained in their
 racial information
 Criticals and 20's
 Rolls of 1's in NeoDBZ are simply low rolls; unlike other
 games and do not automatically fail - though it's certainly
 more like you will fail, since you rolled the lowest result
 possible and they might be more fortunate.
 Rolls of 20's, however, tend to have some special effect tied
 with them depending upon what kind of roll you were making
 as detailled below.
 Strike Rolls
 When you roll a 20 on a strike roll, it automatically hits unless
 the defender rolls a 20 on his dodge or parry and the result of
 his roll is higher than yours. A 20 makes the damage
 automatically Armor Piercing and Shield Piercing. If the
 attack deals damage after Damage Reduction, you've
 critically damaged your opponent and must roll a 1d100 to
 see its effects, outlined in the Critical Hits section.
 Multiattacks can never inflict critical damage, but become AP
 and SP and automatically hit as normal. For Sword Criticals,
 the 1d100 is rolled prior to damage.
 Dodge Rolls
 When you roll a 20 on a dodge roll; you automatically dodge
 unless the attacker rolled a natural 20 for his strike and his
 modifiers beat yours. If you were not hit, you're allowed an
 automatic counterattack. This can be any Basic Attack taken
 immediately as a free action. It costs the normal amount of
 Endurance and/or Ki, but doesn't take any of your actions.
 You can use Superspeeds and Bulk powers with this attack
 by paying the cost as normal, but you can't use anything else.
 You can't perform a Grab as a counter.
 Parry Rolls
 When you roll a 20 on a Parry (be it Telekinetic, Hand to
 Hand or Sword), the parry automatically succeeds unless
 your opponent rolls a higher strike on a 20. You do not get to
 counterattack, but the End loss your opponent suffers for a
 successful parry doubles (except for Telekinetic Parry).
 Parry Blast Rolls
 When you roll a 20 on a Parry Blast, you automatically slap
 the blast back at the attacker and it costs you no Ki to parry it
 back to them. The damage becomes AP and SP. If it's a ki
 attack that cannot be returned to its source, it's only parried
 away. They can defend as normal, but they defend against
 your original strike roll and is not considered an automatic
 hit. If damage goes through, it does not apply a critical hit
 unless the attacker's roll was a 20 and you beat them in
 modifiers.
 Auto-Critical Effects
 If an attack is Auto-Critical (or higher, ala DAC) and a 20 is
 rolled, the critical effect escalates to the next level (AC
 becomes a Double Critical, DAC becomes a Triple critical).
 Triple criticals can not be escalated further, of course and
 20'ing on them only auto hits - unless your opponent rolls a
 20 and beats your final result. Auto-Critical effects are not
 AP/SP like a 20, but become so if a 20 is rolled.
 If someone Advanced Blocks or otherwise reduces an AC
 effect, a d20 is still rolled. If a 20 is rolled, the attack becomes
 a DAC and then is reduced by the Block back down to an AC
 effect. It still has a risk of escalating further if the 1d100 is
 rolled high enough to do so.
 Opposing Natural 20's
 If both the attacker and defender roll 20's as mentioned
 above numerous times, the person with the higher total result
 wins. The critical effect is cancelled out, but the damage is
 still AP and SP if the attacker's roll is higher.
 Notes:
 Natural 20's only inflict a critical effect upon the victim if
 they take damage from the attack (which is AP/SP). If the
 defender can reduce the damage to 0; then they do not
 suffer a critical effect
Damage Types
 There are several different types of damage. While damage is
 dealt almost exclusively to an opponent's HP, some types of
 damage is significantly harder to stop than others.
 (AP) Armor Piercing
 Attacks with this damage type go through armor more
 effectively. In addition to damaging the target's armor
 normally, half of the damage stopped by the armor continues
 on to the target's HP. Further, any Resistance the target has is
 halved.
 Example without Armor: [Damage-Resistance/2] Example
 with Armor: [Damage] To Armor and [+(Damage Stopped)/2]
 to the target before damage reduction.
 (IA) Ignore Armor
 This type of damage acts as though you weren't wearing any
 armor at all (even Natural Armor) and goes right through it. It
 simply bypasses it. Like AS, Resistance is ignored against
 this type of damage. If an attack is IA, you do not need to
 mention it's AP.
 (AS) Armor Shattering
 This type of damage blasts through armor as though it were
 not even there,This superceeds Armor Piercing and Ignore
 Armor, if an attack is listed as both AP/IA and AS, you only
 need to state that it is AS. This damage type inflicts its full
 damage to the opponent's Armor and to their HP. Resistance
 is ignored against this type of damage.
 (SP) Shield Piercing
 This type of damage is harder to stop with your Ki and tends
 to plow through it, though it can be reduced by more
 specialised shields. Your Shield or Aura must state that it's
 SP resistant to block this damage. Resistance is fully
 effective against this type of damage.
 (UP) Unpreventable
 This type of damage is nearly impossible to stop with your Ki.
 Unpreventable damage is normally not preventable by
 Shields or Auras. Armor (including Natural Armor) also does
 not reduce this damage. Nor can it be countered with
 discharges. Resistance is fully effective against this type of
 damage.
 (US) Unshieldable
 The hardest-hitting type of damage there is, this kind of
 damage can not be prevented by any Shield or Aura. Because
 of this, its somewhat rare to see. Resistance and Armor is
 fully effective against this type of damage.
 Attack Add ons
 These modify a specific type of attack to do something
 special, be it being able to redirect the attack, cause someong
 to continually take HP/End damage, or stunning them.
 Remote Attacks
 Ki attacks sometimes have the property of being Remote,
 which means they can be redirected after being fired to try
 and hit someone who dodged the attack initially. This
 requires a second Ki strike roll, which can't benefit from any
 form of Superspeed or Teleportation.
 You can't remote an attack back at someone if they used
 Freeze to avoid it. Remote can alternatively be used to
 redirect the attack away from someone by the user, as long as
 it's before damage is rolled. To utilize this addon; you repay
 the original cost of the attack before superspeeds.
 Double Remote
 Similar to a Remote attack, Double Remote allows the Ki
 attack to be redirected twice after it misses its initial strike.
 By using both redirections of a Double Remote attack, a Ki
 attack can be redirected once against someone after they've
 used the power Freeze.
 Like Remote, Double Remote attacks can also be
 redirected away from someone by the user, before damage
 has been dealt. To utilize this addon; you repay the original
 cost of the attack before superspeeds.
 Stun Attacks
 These attacks cause the person hit to lose one or more of
 their next available action(s) if they take damage from the
 attack. Advanced Blocking a Stunning attack normally
 prevents the Stun effect from an attack, unless otherwise
 stated. Stunning attacks prevent the user from acting in any
 way, but they still are able to regenerate.
 Stun attacks don't stack, if someone has been stunned by
 an attack, they can't be stunned again until they've had an
 action where they can perform an attack, charge, or rest.
 However, if an attack inflicts multiple stuns (such as an
 Ultimate Combo or stuns caused from criticals that deal
 three or more stuns) then these do add up. The person just
 cannot be stunned again until they have had an action.
 In the case a person is Disoriented, Phased, or Stunned,
 the regular one-action stun from the pain of a critical hit is
 replaced by the effects of Disoriented, Phased, or Stunned.
 You still renegerate Ki, HP and Endurance during actions
 lost by stun.
 Flaming/Bleeding Attacks
 These attacks cause a person to lose 1% of their max HP and
 Endurance at the begining of each of their actions before
 regen, to a minimum of 1 point lost. This damage cannot be
 reduced in anyway. This effect persists until the battle ends
 (and the character presumibly treats themself) or the affected
 person uses a power which causes them to regain HP
 (including natural HP regeneration). The attacks adding
 these benefits must deal damage for them to be inflicted
 (Multi-Sword attacks must do damage on the last attack).
Auto Critical Attacks
 These kinds of attacks are especially deadly and
 automatically inflict a critical hit upon the opponent if they hit
 and deal damage. If a 20 is rolled for an AC attack, it
 automatically escalates to a double critical. These attacks are
 not naturally AP/SP like an attack which has a 20 rolled for
 its strike, but often are some type of special damage type.
 (AC) Auto Critical
 These kinds of attacks inflict a level one critical if they deal
 damage.
 (DAC) Double Auto Critical
 These kinds of attacks inflict a level two critical if they deal
 damage.
 (TAC) Triple Auto Critical
 These kinds of attacks inflict a level three critical if they deal
 damage. If a natural 20 is rolled with a TAC attack, no
 additional escalation is possible. A natural 20 still makes it
 auto-hit and AP/SP.
 Invents
 Inventions or simply Invents, are special techniques that are
 your own creation or refer to School Invents. Every character
 has one invent at creation and gains another invent every
 fourth level (4, 8, 12, etc). They're usable once every two
 rounds, unless otherwise stated. For obvious reasons 
invents that deal lasting damage such as Autocrit or Double
 autocrit should be reserved for Deathmatches or trying to
 actually kill your opponent, since they might take offense to it
 being used in a normal fight.
 Declaring your Invent in combat: If you use a school invent
 you have to state the school or the invent name, as you would
 declaring any other power. If you use a personal Invent, you
 have to make clear what kind of Invent it is: Ki, Sword or
 H2H, what level invent it is and whether it is a Single Attack
 or a Multi Attack, through stating it OOC as if it's an addon.
 Unlike previous restarts - personal addons do not need to be
 declared if they have auto crit/double auto crit.
 If you use a personal Shield Invent and have more than one
 personal Shield Invent, you have to state OOC what level you
 gained the invention at similarly to the above.
 Remember, you can't improve School Invents except by
 levelling up; their scaling improvement will be explained in
 the School Invent information.
 Ki invents have a number of special rules, listed below.
 Countering
 This Ki attack add-on allows you to use your Ki invent against
 an incoming Ki attack invent. Multi Attack Ki invents can't be
 countered or used to counter. Instead of dodging, parrying, or
 blocking, you state as your defense that you're using your
 level x Ki attack invent to Counter. You both roll the damages
 of your Ki attacks and subtract the lower result from the
 higher one. The result is the amount of damage that goes to
 the one with the weaker blast.
 The one who receives the damage can't dodge, block or
 parry the incoming damage, but he can use any reflexive
 shield or aura to reduce the damage. If the attack that was
 overcome was generated by two or more people using a Ki
 Attack Invent with the Combo add-on, all of them receive the
 full remaining damage.
 This option may only be selected if you have purchased the
 Ki Attack Invention addon "Counter"; which also allows you
 to add further damage into the attack to overwhelm them.
 Charging Ki Invents
 These invents can be extremely powerful, but require time in
 order to be used to their maximum potential. Trying to gain
 the energy to fire these kinds of invents without taking time
 to do so is risky and inefficient, though it is possible. The
 biggest risk comes from the fact that if there is an action in
 which you cannot charge (such as being stunned or trapped
 in a capture ball) you lose all of your charges, the energy
 dissipating harmlessly into the environment.
 The way you pay the ki cost of a charging invent is different
 from the usual up-front powers that use ki. Insted of paying
 the cost of the attack and simply charging damage, you
 charge the invent to pay for the cost of the attack before you
 can charge damage. You can choose to fire the attack on the
 same action that you finish paying for the base cost of the
 attack, though the minimum amount of actions you can
 charge is two. If you gathered enough with a single charge, it
 means you must wait for your second action to fire it. You can
 not charge Ki for damage and fire the Ki attack on the same
 action. However, if you charge to pay for the Ki cost of the
 invent and have charged ki leftover, you can add the
 remainder to the damage for free and still fire it on that same
 action as if it was spill over.
 Instead, you can choose to pay an additional 50% of the ki
 invent attack's base Ki Cost and not spend any time charging.
 This means you don't need to spend any previous actions
 charging when using a counter ki invent as mentioned above,
 but this additional cost still applies.
 While powering up a blast, you can't parry or dodge or use
 the Telekinetic power Freeze. You can still block and use
 auras and shields however. If you're damaged while you're
 charging up, you do not run the risk of losing your blast.
 If someone tries to grab you while you're charging, you may
 fire your invent immediately at them but may not be used
 with the Counter Addon. They can't dodge, block or parry, but
 can use any reflexive shield or aura. The attacker loses his
 action and does not complete his grab, if he takes damage. If
 you have not paid the base Ki cost for the invent, you must
 pay the +50% ki cost as mentioned earlier if you were unable
 to pay for the base cost in your charged actions. This is the
 only way you may fire an invent before the normal 2 charge
 minimum.
Damage multipliers never affect the additional charged
 damage of a Ki attack, though they do multiply the rest of the
 ki attack as they normally would, like a bulk. Any Ki attack
 which is charged up can't be fired with a Superspeed,
 however actual teleportation powers (Kai Kai and IT) can be
 used with them.
 Example: Gohan wants to power up his invent; Masenko,
 which costs him 225 Ki. The best charging power he has is
 Enhanced Charge, which only gives him 50 Ki per acion.
 He'd have to spend at least 5 actions charging Ki before he
 could fire off the invent or else he would have to pay for an
 additional 50% cost. The extra 25 Ki he charges in the fifth
 action would add the leftover 25 Ki to damage. He could even
 choose to charge for more damage, but if he chooses to do so;
 he can't charge damage on the same action in which he fires
 his attack.
 Notes:
 If you're blinded by the power Taiyoken and someone
 attempts to grab you while you're charging, you can still
 fire your blast at them.
 Taiyoken is not considered a true stun and does not
 prevent charging; only firing the attack.
 The Ligon power "Time Freeze" can be used during
 Charging a Ki attack.
 Multi Attacks
 These are attacks which forego finesse for raw,
 overwhelming force or as many blasts as can be thrown out
 in a short period of time. Despite it's name, you only roll a
 single strike roll for a Multi Attack with the exception of
 Sword Multi's detailed later. For Hand to Hand and Ki, these
 attacks are represented by the formula they use under the
 listed powers. For example:
 (# of attacks)*(base damage+STR/MNT mod) + misc
 bonuses
 With this kind of damage, you only add your miscellaneous
 bonuses once, even though you're making multiple attacks.
 Sword multi's work differently by rolling its strike and
 damage once for each hit in the multi, unless otherwise
 stated by the power in use.
 For example: A level 11 Multi Slash is 6 seperate rolls and
 basic damages.
 Superspeeds
 These powers enhance your speed for the entire action (an
 entire attack, or an entire defense) and thus don't need to be
 paid for with each attack you make in a single action. If you're
 using a combo or anything that requires multiple rolls in one
 action, the Attacker and Defender get their chosen
 Superspeed bonus applied to all their rolls for that action.
 Bulk
 Unlike Superspeed, Bulk is a burst of strength and can only
 apply to a single attack if you make multiple attacks in one
 action. Bulk is added to the first strike of a Multislash, the
 last hit of a Twice and the last hit of any Combos (this rule
 includes HtH and Ki, PKU and Bulk work the same way,
 applying only to the last hit in a combo).
 Critical Hits Multi's cannot score a critical hit, but may be
 AP/SP on a natural roll of 20.
 Combos
 Despite it's name; a Combo is considered a flurry of blows
 not unlike a Multi Attack, however it's a series of follow-up
 attacks leading to a final blow. Combo's only use a single
 strike roll for all the attacks involved in the combo - the
 exception to this is Sword Combo's, which follow the same
 rules as Sword Multi Attacks and roll their seperate strikes.
 Bulk
 Bulk or effects like bulk (such as Bulking Aura), are only
 applied to the final strike in a combo and only ever applies
 once. This includes PKU, because it functions like a Bulk.
 Superspeeds
 Superspeeds function largely the same as a Multi Attack,
 meaning all strikes involved in a combo uses the same
 Superspeed.
 Critical Hits
 Combos cannot score a critical hit, but may be AP/SP on a
 natural roll of 20.
 Damage Multipliers
 Damage multipliers can be anything from the benefits of a
 unique, to the damage multiplier of an Uppercut, to the
 Sword power Thrust. These are anything that improves the
 damage by a percentage (+50%, +10%, +100%, etc). Or
 reduces the damage by a percentage (-50%, -10%, etc).
 When the damage of an attack is multiplied, the base
 damage dice of the attack and the Stat mod relevant to the
 attack are the only parts of the damage that get multiplied
 unless otherwise stated. Any other damage you gain to the
 attack (namely, your miscellaneous bonuses) does not get
 multiplied by the percentage.
 Multi Attacks (including Combos in this definition) can
 gain the benefit of having their damage multiplied as well, but
 the effect is reduced because of the amount of attacks you're
 making at once, unless otherwise stated. They receive half
 the normal damage bonus as other attacks. So if you had
 +10% to all HtH damage (from say, Damaging Aura) and you
 make a Multi Punch attack, you would gain +5%, instead of
 the usual +10%.

Advanced Combat
 Special Moves
 These are attacks which are simple enough for everyone to
 do, but uncommon tactics enough to be listed separately from
 Basic Attacks. The powers listed here are defensive and
 meant to help you protect someone else in the midst of battle,
 which can be a rather difficult task if your opponent knows
 what they're doing. Remember: You can only use these
 abilities during a fight or in special circumstances during an
 event, if the GM allows you to do so.
 Remember to read the details on Deathmatches under
 Basic Combat; Types of Combat to learn more about saving
 lives.
 Power Name: Interception
 Level: Basic
 Cost: 3 End, 4 for a Multi + half the base cost of the ki attack
 if successful.
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: You and your ally come up with a clever plan to
 lure your enemy into a false sense of victory; you dive
 between your ally and his opponent during his attack, not
 unlike the Take the Blast manuver. However in this one,
 you're already reaching back to swat the ki attack away. This
 is great for defending those who are unable to defend
 themselves.
 You must have the parry Blast Power in order to declare
 the use of this manuver, when your ally is the target of a ki
 attack. Roll a Hand to Hand strike roll, using your STR/5 in
 place of your DEX/5, with a -7 penalty to your roll. You can
 choose to parry multi attacks and combos, but you take an
 additional -7 penalty to the strike roll. On a natural 20, you
 automatically succeed with the parry and it costs you no
 endurance or ki. A blast parried in this way may never be
 parried back.
 Due to the bait and switch tactic used here; on a failure
 both targets take full damage from the attack as well as
 additional effects,
 You must use a Superspeed when using this manuver for it
 to succeed. Using this manuver consumes the last action
 from your APR, if you don't have an action in the initiative you
 may not use this manuver.
 Next time DODDDDDDGGGGGGGEEE
 Power Name: Taking the Blast
 Level: Basic
 Cost: 1 End
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: This isn't an actual attack, but rather a defensive
 maneuver. You try to place yourself infront of an incoming Ki
 attack and thereby intercepting the blast before it hits
 someone else. You make a Dodge roll with a +4 bonus.
 Before your opponents strike is rolled; the person you're
 defending declares a defense and then Taking the Blast is
 resolved; If you successfully beat their attack strike roll, then
 you've taken the blast in place of the person you were
 protecting and you take the damage instead of the original
 target. If you fail, the attack has bypassed your attempt and
 the original target defends with their declared defense.
 You can't block, parry, dodge (obviously) or Counter, but
 you can use reflexive shields and auras normally.
 You can only attempt this maneuver if you have actions left
 in the round and it makes you lose your next available action.
 You can't do this while blinded, stunned, Frozen, from within
 a Cap Ball or Involved in a Grapple. You must use a
 Superspeed to use this power.
 Power Name: Tackle
 Level: Basic
 Cost: 1 End
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: This isn't an actual attack, but rather a defensive
 maneuver. If someone is being attacked by a HtH or Sword
 attack, you may try to tackle them out of the way. It deals a
 small amount of damage to the person you're trying to
 protect, but in most cases it ends up causing them less
 damage than the attack itself does.
 First off, the person you're wanting to tackle must want to
 be protected, if they don't - you can't tackle them. Assuming
 they allow it, they declare a defense in the event that Tackle is
 unsuccessful. You roll a Dodge roll with a +4 bonus against
 the attack's strike. If you succeed, the person you're tackling
 takes (1d6+(STR+SPD)/2) UP damage (no other damage
 mods are added to this attack) from the tackle, while you take
 the attack yourself.
 You can't block, parry or dodge (obviously), but you can use
 reflexive shields and auras normally.
 You can only attempt this maneuver if you have actions left
 in the round and it makes you lose your next available action.
 You can't do this while blinded, stunned, Frozen, from within
 a Cap Ball or Involved in a Grapple. You must use a
 Superspeed to use this power.
 When it says the person that's being tackled must agree to
 it, this is an OOC agreement.
Escape from a Fight
 If someone wants to run away from a scene, you must first
 roll initiative to determine if you were able to or not. You can
 not run away without doing so during combat. If you're
 already in combat, then you must spend three consecutive
 actions doing nothing but fleeing. You must dodge all attacks
 aimed at you during this time and if you're hit then you have
 to start the process over again. If you manage to successfully
 escape, then you must calculate your flight speed and
 determine how fast you can go. If your flight speed is higher
 than your opponent(s), you successfully escape combat and
 run away and they can't catch up with you. If their flight speed
 is higher, they can catch up to you and start the combat again
 after you run, using a new initiative. If you're trying to escape
 and your opponent is not flying, it takes only a single action
 and you automatically escape. You can't escape combat if
 you're not flying.
 There are special escape rules for powers which are actual
 teleports (Kai Kai and IT), which are listed with the powers
 themselves. If someone tries to escape and you have one of
 those powers, then you can teleport after them and re-declare
 initiative if you can sense them. They can try to flee again if
 they wish, but you can do this as many times as you can use
 your power and providing you can sense them.
 In the event that you're unable to escape because you're
 terrible at dodging or too slow, you can utilize the power
 Taiyoken or Cap Ball, amongst other things in order to
 produce a 3-action string where you can effectively escape
 undeterred. While your opponent is Blinded or Contained,
 they cannot pursue you or know where you went, so long as
 you hide your powerlevel.
 When escaping from a fight that has hostile spectators; you
 can effectively ignore them. Spectators tend to be too far
 away from the fight to make any meaningful attempt to
 pursue you and even if they did, they would be classified as
 interfering with the fight - which could land them in trouble if
 they were told not to.
 Notes:
 Space Flight can't be used in combat and can't be used to
 escape a combat. If you have this power, then you must
 successfully escape before you can activate Space Flight
 to leave the planet. You can still be intercepted in space if
 they are capable of long-range ki sensing and have a faster
 space flight power.
 Rescuing/Escaping with allies
 There are a few factors that apply when you are trying to
 escape a battle with an ally that is unable to do so themself
 either due to their flight speed, dodge ability or being
 incapacitated.
 It takes an action to retrieve your ko'd/dead ally before you
 can start to flee. If they are concious, they can initiate this
 action. -Picking up and trying to fly off with someone as
 deadweight is a little taxing and causes you to fly at
 reduced speeds, you Fly at only 75% speed. -You have -5 to
 dodge while carrying a fallen ally. If you are struck and
 your concious ally is the target, you can release them to
 allow them to dodge - but must start over from the initial
 action of grabbing them. -When blocking an attack; the
 fallen ally takes 20% of the damage you recieve after
 Damage Reduction. And fleeing must begin over again. 
When using space flight to carry someone, you must pay
 the ki cost of space flight for them, too. -While carrying
 someone you may only make attacks or parry if you have
 the unique Goon, otherwise you may do neither. -If a
 dodge is failed from a hand to hand or sword attack; it
 lands on whichever of the two was targeted. However
 hitting the target being carried does not set back their 3
 actions of fleeing on the main guy. -If a dodge is failed
 from a ki attack both people take full damage. You may
 use an aura to protect your ally, if you do not use one to
 protect yourself. This sets back your 3 action escape as
 normal.
 Surrendering
 If you don't want to get knocked out or be called a coward for
 running away, you can simply surrender. During a fight, you
 can concede defeat between attacks, even when it's not your
 turn to do so.
 The only attacks you can't surrender between, are combos 
with exception of sword combos.
 For example; if you had an action string of GGG F, you
 could throw three attacks in quick succession, but if one of
 those attacks KO'd or caused a Concede, you're not required
 to roll the damage on additional attacks.
 Conceding is always be done before damage is rolled or
 immediately following a damage reduction.
AFK during combat.
 If you must go AFK; please warn your opponent out of
 courtesy. Even if you simply have to type AFK at an
 inopportune time, we understand that real life takes
 prescedence - especially in an emergency.
 When a player is afk for 15 minutes or longer during
 combat, you are able to take credit for the victory as if the
 scene has ended. The person simply gives up and leaves.
 For Deathmatches the rules are slightly different. If a
 player AFKs in a deathmach, it does not end after 15
 minutes. You and the player have to resolve the fight from
 where it left off - you're expected to save your sheet in
 whatever status it was left in. The disconnected player must
 resolve this within 24 hours or arrange a date for a resolution
 or risk a GM intervening to declare their character dead.
 Neither participant may RP or Fight without GM consent,
 since it often complicates matters.
 For Team Fights or events; the player is simply skipped. If
 they do not return quickly enough, they may lose their actions
 all together. With warning, a GM can choose to allow a player
 to retrieve lost actions so long as it supercedes actions
 currently taking place. For example:
 Goku was AFK while Krillin and Freiza fought. Freiza was
 about to Piercing Beam Krillin and end his life; when Goku
 returned to take the blast with 2 of his remaining actions that
 are left to be resolved. He cannot 'lose' one of these unspent
 actions, but he could use his actions to attack Freiza normally
 as if it was prior to his offensive action. He also would not be
 able to Cap Ball Freiza, now knowing he planned to Kill
 Krillin with the next blow
 Fighting in Hostile Environments
 Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you find yourself in a
 situation that may not be favourable to your health. Varying
 types of Environments effect different races. For example;
 some are immune to space, but noone is particularly immune
 to moulten lava.
 When fighting in an Environment that is dangerous to you
 without sufficient protection, your Life Points (not Health
 Points) and Endurance drains at a rate of 1% (minimum of 1
 point drain) for each of your APR used. If you're not immune
 to the environment, you do not regenerate HP, LP or
 Endurance. When you're down to 1 LP, you're considered
 unconcious and this drain ceases. Endurance will continue to
 drain until it hits 0 and you're rendered unconcious in that
 way.
 Left in an unconcious state in a hostile environment, you
 die within the Neo Hour once you have 1 LP remaining.
 Of course, there's protective suits that can defend against
 these environments, which can be found in the Stuff to Buy
 portion of the PHB.
 Table of
 Contents
 Examples of Environments
 Space:
 Races that are immune to Space are listed in the PHB. Using
 the power Space Flight, a Spaceship or a Spacesuit can
 temporarily grant immunity.
 Lava:
 No races are immune to the searing temperatures. This is
 what makes a planetary explosion so dangerous. Space flight
 could allow someone to travel through this, protected by their
 ki.
 Poison Atmosphere:
 Races that are immune to Space, could be immune to this
 kind of environment. Using the power Space Flight, a
 Spaceship or a Spacesuit can temporarily grant immunity.
 Water:
 All Races are immune to drowning, so long as they are
 conscious. It's a pretty easy thing to shield yourself with ki
 against water.
 Gravity:
 No race is immune to extreme gravity, such as Jupiter's core
 or a Black Hole. There is no way to survive such extremes.
 Lesser gravity, could simply range from a hindrance to
 dangerous.
 There are likely other Environments that could be created,
 but this is just a basic idea.

Grappling
 Quick Notes: For the purposes of clarity and understanding of
 these rules, the person CONTROLLING THE GRAPPLE, is
 considered "Attacker" and the person BEING HELD is the
 "Defender" - this naming theme is specific to the roles and
 not which end of an attack you find yourself at. You can shield
 attacks in a grapple unless it specifically says otherwise. To
 use grappling mechanics, ensure you understand how it
 works.
 1. Initiating a Grapple
 Power Name: Grab Level: Basic Cost: 1 End UPR: 2/Round
 Description: You reach out and try to grab ahold of someone,
 be it by the arm, leg, or whatever. This attack deals no
 damage to your opponent and has a -4 penalty to its Strike
 roll. This attack is used to begin a grapple. The defender can
 only choose to dodge the Grab, though they can let
 themselves be hit. Grabs can't be parried.
 You can only attempt to grab twice per round. If you try to
 grab someone who is charging a blast, they have the option of
 immediately firing the blast at you - hitting you automatically
 as you go to grab them. You can't block the attack and being
 hit by the blast cancels your attempt to grab them.
 Grabs can not be used as an attack for any Counter and
 can not be used as a part of a Combo. Even if you're
 Ambidexterous, you can not Grab and use a basic attack on
 the same action. Attempting to grab someone with an
 advanced grab power consumes the 1/round use of the grab
 ability and 1 of your regular grab attempts.
 2. Attacker Options
 The Attacker in a grapple can do several things to the
 Defender, while he has them at his mercy. When reffering to
 a grapple between two people, refer to this section. Attacking
 into an existing grapple are completely seperate rules and
 should be treated as such. On their action, they may do any of
 the following;
 Kick
 Elbow
 Punch
 Knee
 Any power from the Powering Up tree
 Eyebeams
 Mouthblast
 A Dagger's Basic Attack
 Use a Grappling Attack or Advanced Grapple Power
 Release the Defender
 Notes:
 All of these moves require no strike roll to hit, but a d20 is
 still rolled to check for a critical.
 Critical hits may not escalate beyond the first level. If you
 roll an escalation, reroll the 1d100.
 You can not use any Block powers while in a grapple.
 As the Attacker, you can choose to release the Defender in
 response to an attack from the Defender; the Attacker can
 try to Dodge the attack, but can't parry or block it.
 3. Defender Options
 The person being grabbed is even more restricted in what
 they can do, and may only use the following powers. When
 reffering to a grapple between two people, refer to this
 section. Attacking into an existing grapple are completely
 seperate rules and should be treated as such. The Defender,
 or person being held in a grapple, is even more restricted in
 what they can do and may only use the following as their
 action:
 Elbow
 Knee
 Eyebeams
 Mouthblast
 A Dagger's Basic Attack
 Flare (only to break the Grapple)
 Break Grapple
 Shift Grapple
 Notes:
 All of these moves require no strike roll to hit, but a d20 is
 still rolled to check for a critical.
 Critical hits may not escalate beyond the first level. If you
 roll an escalation, reroll the 1d100.
 You can not use any Block powers while in a grapple.
 Flare can not be used to damage an opponent in a
 Grapple.
 4. Manipulating a Grapple
 Sometimes you simply do not want to be part of this dance.
 When this is the case, the Defender may attempt to escape
 the controlled position he is in, by one of the following:
 Breaking a Grapple
 There are two methods of attempting to break out of a
 grapple: using one's own strength, or trying to use your
 energy to force your opponent away from you, flaring them
 off. Flaring requires you have learnt the Flare power. The
 grapple is successfully broken if the result is below 60.
 Using just your strength, the formula is: Template: {1d100
(Defender's STR/2)+(Attacker's STR/2)} Using the power
 Flare, the formula is: Template: {1d100-(Ki Charged/4)+
 (Attacker's STR/2)}
 Shift Grapple
 The Defender can try to shift the Grapple in their favour and
 switch roles to become the person in control, instead of
 escaping. The formula is the same, as if he were trying to
 break the Grapple using his strength and succeeds on a roll
 of 60 or lower, only the end result is different. You can not
 use the power Flare to shift a grapple.
 Template: {1d100-(Defender's STR/2)+(Attacker's STR/2}
5. Attacking into a Grapple
 Sometimes, the easiest target might be your ally or you're
 given permission to fire on friendlies. Attempting to attack
 people who are involved in a grapple can usually result in
 your unintended target being thrown into your strike or other
 nasty side effects. Both people involved in the grapple are
 restricting one another, so defending themselves is near
impossible. Attacking into a grapple may not have critical
 effects, but can become AP/SP.
 Hand to Hand and Sword attacks
 You declare a target as normal, when making a Hand to Hand
 or Sword attack roll. If the Attacker is the intended target, he
 may choose to let go of the Defender in order to Dodge the
 outside interferance - he cannot block or parry. If the Attacker
 does this, the Defender can make a Shift Grapple roll to
 prevent him from escaping the grapple and insted is hit by
 the attack and the roles of the original Attacker and Defender,
 are switched, with the old Defender now in control of the
 grapple as the Attacker. Alternatively, the Attacker may
 choose to try and use the Defender as a shield, when
 targetted. The Attacker rolls a shift grapple check and on
 success, the Defender is automatically hit insted. Using this
 option takes the Attacker's next available action in the round.
 If the Defender is the initial target of the attack, he can try
 to force the Attacker of the grapple to take the hit insted, by
 making a shift grapple check. On success, the Attacker is
 automatically hit insted. The Defender and Attacker does not
 shift roles.
 Ki attacks
 When firing a Ki attack into a Grapple, all participants in the
 Grapple take full damage (Splitforms are only one person)
 from the blast. When a Ki Attack targets the grapple, the
 Defender may roll a shift grapple check before damage is
 dealt. If the result is below -40, the Defender has broken free
 from the grapple and may dodge (he may not block or parry),
 while the Attacker is automatically hit. If the result is higher
 than 40, the Attacker if they so wish, can let go and attempt a
 dodge (they may not block or parry) while the Defender is
 automatically hit. If the result is between -40 and +40, both
 are hit as normal.
 6. Multiple Grapple Rules
 Only two people may grab a specific person at any given time,
 this includes Split Forms. Treat additional entries to the
 grapple as a seperate grapple, producing a grapple 'chain', if
 you will. So for example, we have an Attacker and Defender. If
 someone were to grab the Attacker, he is both Attacker and
 Defender in two grapples. Alternatively, if the Defender was
 the target, he is now Defender in two grapples and must
 make a seperate Break/Shift for each of them. You may only
 be the Attacker in one of your grapples, at any one time
 unless you have the Goon unique. Grabbing onto an existing
 Grapple simply takes an action and is automatically
 successful.
 You may not shift to, or initiate Muy-Thai Clinch or Back
 Grapple while a player is already grabbed. If you already have
 someone grabbed in one of these holds, you maintain your
 position but you are unable to use any of the Muy-Thai Clinch
 or Back Grapple abilities, even if the ability does not release
 the person. If you have the Defender in a rear naked choke
 when someone else joins the grapple, you must release it on
 your next action.
 When multiple people have a hold on one person, neither
 of them can use the powers Throw, Body Slam or Ramming
 Body Slam until one of them releases their hold. They can
 still use attacks which do not end the grapple.

Critical Hits
 Recovering from Criticals
 Some critical hits are temporary and only lasts for that attack
 or the remainder of the fight, such as Power Blow or
 Disorientated. This means there is no associated recovery
 time, because it's not long-lasting.
 When recovering from critical effects, such as broken
 bones, record the end time of the fight to use as the start of
 your healing time. Criticals typically takes some time to heal
 from, especially without the aid of Racial Regeneration, a
 rejuvenator or a hospital. It takes 1 Neo week (1 RL day) to
 recover from a level one critical effect without the aid of a
 rejuvenator, during which you can't fight. If you do, the
 healing time is reset. Double criticals take 3 Neo weeks (3 RL
 days) to recover from without the aid of a rejuvenator. Triple
 criticals and any lost limbs are permanent, unless a character
 visits a hospital or a rejuvenator to fix the injury or has some
 advanced form of self-healing, capable of curing this level of
 Critical injury. If you have been inflicted by more than one
 critical effect, the times and costs to recover from them are
 cumulative, adding together with each additional injury.
 Miscellaneous Critical Hits
 Some criticals can be inflicted out of combat, on a person
 who is unable to protect themselves. These may also not be
 on par with normal criticals. Like, having your fingers broken,
 for example. This isn't the same as having your arm itself be
 broken (although it might be just as painful), so in this case,
 you can go to a hospital and typically have it healed within a
 negligible amount of time without any penalty beside its cost.
 It takes 100 Credits to heal each critical of this type. Each
 time you get another critical of this type, the cost to heal it
 doubles. Hospitals enjoy repeat customers and know to
 exploit the necessity for their aid.
 Special Limb Criticals
 Tails
 If you have a tail (regardless of what kind of tail it is) and your
 leg suffers a critical hit, there's a 50% chance your tail is hit
 instead. Your opponent rolls this additional chance, after
 landing on a leg critical to confirm if it is the tail or not.
 If it's a Normal Critical, your tail is damaged and all attacks
 with it take -8 to Strike.
 If it's a Double Critical, your tail is broken and can not be
 used for combat until healed (heals at the same rate as an
 arm).
 If it's a Triple Critical, your tail is severed from your body and
 is considered a lost limb. It may not be used until replaced.
 This invokes a -10 strike and dodge penalty, due to the
 misbalancing nature of having no tail. You reduce this penalty
 at a rate of -2, per Neo Week (1 RL day) - as getting used to
 the new balance of life without one. Saiyans that start the
 game without their tail, do not recieve this penalty.

 Eyes
 Loss of an eye is pretty painful and throws off your aim,
 incurring a -2 Strike penalty. But losing both Eyes, inflicts a
 permanent -5 to all Strikes and dodges unless they can be
 replaced. On the up side, you're now immune to the power
 Taiyoken.
 Multiple Critical Hits
 If you roll a crit that breas the same limb twice, you may
 decide to break the other limb or to upgrade the current crit
 to the next level. If you break the ribs twice then they may
 only be upgraded to the next level. If a limb has been
 destroyed then nothing further may damage it.
 When you start losing limbs, maybe the fight has gotten a
 LITTLE to intense.

Sharp Criticals
 These are the critical hits for extremely sharp objects,
 Kienzans, weapons, and the like.
 Sharp Criticals function differently than HtH or Ki
 criticals, Sharp critials have their effect applied before the
 damage is rolled, and before any damage reduction is made.
 Power and Mighty Slash's +50% damage is applied to the
 total damage that was rolled (including bulk and other
 modifiers), and is applied before any reductions are made to
 it.
 The effects of removing a limb or the additional Hand to
 Hand criticals Sharp Double Crits cause are still possible to
 prevent if the victim somehow prevents the UP damage of a
 Sharp crit - such as through a UP shield, Ki's Ending, or
 enough Resistance. If any damage is taken, however, all of the
 critical's effects take place.
 Sharp criticals can still be reduced by Advanced block, as
 normal.
 Normal Critical Hit
 Roll 1d100. The victim always loses one action, due to the
 pain.
 1 - 59 Power Slash The Damage is now Unpreventable
 (UP)
 60 - 85 Mighty Slash as Power Slash, and +50% damage.

 Critical Hit table.

 overhead! Once set in motion, the Ki continues to gain in
 intensity while you are free to perform other actions. This is a
 Charging Ki Attack with 0 damage. Releasing it takes an
 action, after which it will automatically Charge itself on each
 of your actions, adding 10% of your Maximum Ki to its
 damage. This leaves you free to perform other actions during
 your turns, although you may not Charge yourself (whether
 into this attack or otherwise). This consumes one of your
 Charges per battle on each of your turns. In the case of
 Androids, their Ki Regeneration doesn't function while this
 attack is Charging, but it still adds 10% of their Maximum Ki
 to the damage per turn. Nothing but detonating the sphere
 can stop this attack from charging, and the user may still
 attack, dodge and parry as normal. Even Capture Ball or
 Dokuken will not stop this sphere from charging! This attack
 gains a +Level/2+10 bonus to strike, but does not benefit
 from superspeeds.
 The sphere is detonated in the following situations
 The user spends an action to throw it down on the
 battlefield. It deals its damage to all enemies.
 The user is rendered unconcious, killed, turned to stone or
 turned to candy, in which case it detonates harmlessly.
 Someone is grappled and thrown into the sphere. Throw's
 normal effects are replaced with this attack's damage,
 which is applied only to the unfortunate soul throw into it.
 The victim gets a Break Attempt (including Flare Break)
 to dive away from the sphere at the last second, turning it
 into a normal Throw and preventing the sphere from
 being detonated. In this case, the detonation may only be
 Blocked.
 The sphere may be attacked. It may not defend itself, but it
 is immune to all non-damaging effects and the user may
 use Shields on its behalf. It has Level x 200 HP and Level
 x 10 Resistance. If the Sphere is "killed" then it detonates,
 attacking the person who killed it -and- the user, both of
 whom may only Block the attack (including advanced
 forms of Block). Template: {((0+MNT Mod) + Misc Mods +

Sword Fighting Style
 Powers: You gain the following powers at the listed levels.
 Unlike schools, you do not gain a power in a higher category
 if you already know the listed powers. After level 1, you will
 always have the option of one of two powers. These powers
 ignore the normal pre-requsites.
 Every level up you gain one power from Sword,
 Superspeed, or Ki Body Enhancement Power Trees.

 At level 8 you may select one of the following Powers.
 They may not be otherwise learned.
 Power Name: Tireless
 Level: X2
 Type: Passive
 Description: A character with this discipline loses no
 endurance for making a basic sword attack. All his sword
 powers cost him one less endurance per slash, excluding the
 sword power Twice. For example, a multi-slash only costs 2
 endurance per slash, instead of the normal 3, and using the
 Thrust power costs him 2 endurance. Additionally, the
 endurance costs for personal sword invents are halved,
 rounded up.
 Power Name: Harmony Style
 Level: X2
 Type: Passive
 Description: Whenever a character with this power
 successfuly dodges an attack or successfully parries an attack
 using the Sword power "Parrying Strike," they may make a
 Basic Sword Attack against the person who attacked them.
 This costs 4 END, instead of the normal cost.
 At level 10 you may select one of the following Powers.
 They may not be otherwise learned.
 Power Name: Kharmic Strike
 Level: Z
 Type: One
 Cost: 6 End. (15 Ki per level)
 UPR: 1/Battle
 Description: The opponent performs an attack and in the
 blink of an eye you are behind them sheathing your sword.
 You are obviously wounded--but so are they. This power is a
 special defense that may be declared. When your opponent
 declares an attack on you, you may declare you're using
 Kharmic Strike as your reaction, alongside a Block. You take
 damage normally, and perform a sword counterattack attack
 that gains a +5 bonus to strike, deals +1d8*10 damage per
 level and stuns the attacker for one action if it hits. This
 counterattack happens even if you would die, be rendered
 unable to attack, or are knocked unconcious from the attack
 its used against, and it ignores all critical effect penalties. If
 used against an attack that renders you unconcious or kills
 you, then all dice in the attack are maximized and the attack
 becomes Auto-Critical. This only works if the attack itself
 renders you unconcious or kills you, not if you use a power
 like Ki's Ending to render yourself unconcious.

 UPR: 1/Battle
 Description: A sword attack modified by this add-on is
 capable of severing the opponent's connection to their
 shields. Any shields used against this attack may not be used
 again for the rest of the battle. This add-on is declared
 alongside Bulk and Superspeeds.

 The lone wolf fighting style is for those who prefer to fight
 alone. As such you are somewhat stronger and flexible than
 most. However you may not gain the benefits of a guild or
 personal school. Furthermore any fight you participate in,
 your allies gain half experience fighting by your side. Finally if
 two lone wolves ally, no one on their side gets any experience

Inventions
 An Invent is a special, personal powerup or attack that has
 been developed by your own hands to do exactly what you
 want it to do. Every character has one and continues to
 improve as time goes on. Examples of a personal invent are
 ki attacks like Vegeta's Galic Gun, Gokus Kaioken and
 Piccolo's Special Beam Cannon.
 Invents are defined by their 'level', which is the level they
 are aquired - not your current level. Characters begin with a
 single invent at level 1 and gain invents every fourth level (4,
 8, 12, etc) from then on. Invents can be used once per two
 rounds (except for Statboosters, which can only be used
 1/Battle). This can also be called "Invent Level" to easier
 differenciate the two meanings.
 Invents begin with a base of 30 Invent Points, which can be
 altered by Uniques or Racial traits. Each level you gain after
 aquiring the Invent, accrues cumulative points. The next level
 after obtaining the invent, increases the points by the
 previous ammount +5.

 Ki Inventions
 Ki Attack Inventions function like most other Ki attacks, but
 they are usually more focused or carry special properties
 that, when used during a time of need, can overwhelm an
 opponent for little cost to the user. They could be attacks that,
 when fired as a group, combine into a swirling beam of
 energy or a flurry of individual balls of energy that eventually
 merge into one massive explosion. To create a Ki Attack
 Invention, you decide on the dice type you wish to use. You
 may not change this choice later, so pick carefully. You must
 have the Discharge power to make a Ki Attack Invent. Attacks
 Must have the Charging add-on already. This simply
 makes your Charging more efficient, adding 25 extra
 damage for each action you charge the attack. This can be
 purchased an unlimited number of times. One level of
 Increased Charging also increases the ammount of
 actions you can charge a ki invent to your level1.5 actions

 Increases the Ki Cost by 25% Your attack's damage
 becomes Armor Piercing, meaning it can penetrate
 people's armor and physical resilience. Armor Piercing is
 fully described in Advanced Combat.
 (150 points) Auto Critical
 Increases the Ki Cost by 50%
 Multi-Attack can not be taken with this add-on. The Ki of
 your blast becomes volatile, severely injuring those it hits.
 Your attack becomes Auto Critical, meaning if it does any
 Combo Attacks can not have the Multi-attack add-on used
 with them. This unique addition to a Ki Attack allows you
 to combine the energy of your attack with that of another
 person's, enabling you to create an even more destructive
 blast of energy to take down an exceptionally tough
 opponent.
 In order to use this add-on, you and up to two allies must
 all have this add-on. You can each fire your blasts and form a
 single, more powerful blast. You must have an action after
 each other, meaning no one acts in-between your actions. You
 all pay the normal ki cost for your own attacks, plus 4
 Endurance.
 The person with the highest strike roll uses their strike to
 determine if it hits, with an additional +5 to the roll. If you hit,
 roll the damage for all the attacks used, add them together,
 then add 10% to the total. The attack is considered to be from
 a single source, thus all of the attacks share each other's
 special properties (Stun, AP, Remote, etc).
 You can not perform a Combo with your own Split form,
 Cell Jr, Janenba Mini, or Ghetti Clone.

 Combat Chapter for its effects.
 (250 points) Double Auto Critical
 Increases the Ki Cost by 100%
 Must have the Auto Critical addon.
 Multi-Attack can not be taken with this add-on. The Ki of
 your blast becomes extremely volatile, and is easily
 capable of destroying those it hits. Your attack becomes
 Double Auto Critical, meaning if it does any damage, it
 inflicts a level two critical effect. Refer to the Combat
 Chapter for its effects.
 (25 points) Charging
 You can now gather ki from the surroundings and infuse your
 attack with it, allowing you to power up a blast, given enough
 time. You can use any of the normal Charge powers to add to
 the damage, except for the power Mega Charge. Instead of
 adding the Ki to your own ki pool, the ki goes directly into
 your attack, adding 1 point for every 1 ki you would charge.
 Androids add double the amount of Ki they would normally
 regenerate in an action, instead (and don't regenerate on
 actions spent charging into the attack).
 (50 points) Counter
 This add-on allows you to enhance your ki attack if you
 choose to use it to counter, or have your own attack
 countered, giving you a last bit of oomph to overtime their
 energy. You can add up to an extra 50 Ki per level, adding 1
 damage per point of Ki.
 (Variable) Multi-attack
 Multi-attacks can not have the AC or DAC add-ons used
 with them. With this add-on, you can separate your attack
 into multiple blasts, much like a Multi Fireball, which arc
 and strike your opponent to inflict heavy damage from
 multiple sources.
 This addition costs 50 Invent Points for every 1d8*10 base
 damage the attack deals, each time you buy it. It allows you to
 shoot 1d3+1 blasts per time you buy it, but costs an
 additional 100 ki per 1d3+1. You can buy this multiple times,
 up to once per level, but once you buy it the first time, you can
 not later purchase more base damage. You can not charge
 Multi-Attack Ki Invents for damage, but you can charge Multi
Attack Ki invents to pay for the cost.
 Template: {(1d3+1 per time bought)*(Base Damage + Ki

(40 points) Range Boost
 Increases the Ki Cost by 10% Most Ki attacks are only
 good for a (relatively) short distance, fighting upon a
 planet, you can hit anyone within sight range fairly easily,
 but beyond that and your ki tends to fizzle and dissipate.
 With this add-on, your attack can be used from space.
 This add-on can not be used to attack an individual person
 from space, only to attack the planet itself. For the most
 part, it's used to destroy planets, but be warned: There
 tend to be people on most inhabited planets that would
 stop someone attempting to blow up their home. And the
 planet it's on.
 (50 points) Remote Attack
 You can redirect the Ki of your attack even after firing it,
 allowing you to attack with it again if you miss. You can only
 redirect your attack once. Remote is fully described in
 Advanced Combat.
 (75 points) Double Remote Attack
 Must have the Remote add-on already. Your can redirect
 the Ki of your attack twice after firing it, allowing you to
 attack with it again if you miss. This functions just like
 Remote--it's simply a second Remote, which allows you to
 do certain things with it, like remoting the attack even
 after your opponent has used Freeze. Double Remote is
 fully describe in Advanced Combat.
 (50 points) Stunning Attack
 Increases the Ki Cost by 20% Your attack now disorients
 your opponent when it hits them. Unless your opponent
 prevents all of the damage (or Advanced Blocks), they are
 stunned for one action. This can not be purchased
 multiple times.
 (10 points) Wide Radius
 Increases the Ki Cost by 5% Your Ki blast becomes larger,
 allowing it to hit an area with greater ease. It makes it
 easier to hit your opponent (and the surroundings nearby,
 whether you want to or not). Each time it's purchased it
 gives you a +1 bonus to your Strike roll, and can be
 purchased 15 times. The Ki Cost increase applies each
 time it's taken.

 Hand to Hand Inventions
 Hand to Hand attack Inventions function like regular attacks,
 however they tend to be catered heavily towards what the
 user wishes them to do. They can be attacks that use your
 allies combined attack to deal devestating hits or utilize a
 sudden burst of energy to flatten your target. To create a
 Hand to Hand Invention, you decide on the dice type you
 wish to use. You may not change this choice later, so pick
 carefully. Your attack must also cost a minimum of 1
 Endurance.

 with a barrage of attacks, wearing them down with one
 blow after another.
 This addition costs 50 Invent Points for every Base

 allows you to deal 1d5+1 blows per time purchased, up to
 1d5+1 per level. Once this addition is bought, you can not
 improve the base damage any further.

 Your attack's damage becomes Shield Piercing, meaning it
 can penetrate people's shields and auras much easier than

 (20 points per damage die) Armor
 Shattering
 Increases the End cost by 5, Increases by 10 if it is a Multi

 meaning it completely bypasses any physical barriers that
 try to absorb the damage, destroying them while doing so.
 This ability fully replaces Armor Piercing, and is
 described in Advanced Combat.
 (50 points) Stunning Attack
 Increases the End cost by 2 Your attack now disorients
 your opponent when it hits them. If your attack hits,
 unless your opponent Advanced Blocks, they are stunned
 for one action. This can not be purchased multiple times.
 (10 points) Blinding Speed
 Increases the End cost by 1 per 3 times taken You
 practice with your technique to the point of memorizing
 the motion and speeding up its execution, enabling you to
 strike faster, leaving them no time to react. This bonus
 adds +1 to strike for every 10 invent points spent. You can
 take this add-on a maximum of 15 times.
 (150 points) Auto Critical
 Increases the End cost by 1 per Damage die.
 Multi-Attack can not be taken with this add-on.
 Must have enough Damage die equal to the die type (4d4,
 6d6, 8d8) to purchase this add-on. Your attack is brutal
 and violent, breaking those struck by it and leaving them a
 broken pile. Your attack becomes Auto Critical, meaning if
 it does any damage, it inflicts a level one critical effect.
 Refer to the Combat Chapter for its effects.
 (250 points) Double Auto Critical
 Increases the End cost by 3 per Damage die.
 Must have the Auto Critical add-on already.
 Multi-Attack can not be taken with this add-on. Your attack
 becomes extremely brutal and violent, leaving your
 enemies mauled piles on the ground. Your attack becomes
 Double Auto Critical, meaning if it does any damage, it
 inflicts a level two critical effect. Refer to the Combat
 Chapter for its effects.
 (10 points per die) Ki Enhancement
 Ki Enhancement can not have the Multi-Attack add-on
 used with it. You can now channel your energy into your
 attack, enabling you to deal much more damage than
 normal. The damage die of your attack is now 10 (1d410,
 etc). In addition, all bonuses to Ki are added to your
 invent. It costs 10 Ki per die, and you must pay for all die
 in the attack, or the Ki Enhancement will not take effect.
 This addition costs 10 invent points per damage die your
 invent has.
 (50 points) Flaming Strike
 Increases the Ki cost by 25%
 Must have the Ki Enhancement add-on already. Your
 attack now has a lingering effect--lighting the person on
 fire, a discharg eof electricity disrupting their body, an
 open wound unable to heal. When you strike the target,
 the injury inflicted does not immediately fade, but
 continues to fester. Your attack has the effect of Flaming,
 which is fully described in Advanced Combat.
(75 points) Push Off
 Costs 3 End and 50 Ki for the Dodge bonus.
 Push Off can not be added to a Multi-Attack. This addition
 allows you to activate it immediately when your opponent
 closes in, striking them right after you evade. When your
 opponent declares an attempt to grab you, you can declare
 that you're Pushing Off with your invent and dodging. You
 roll your dodge with a +5 bonus to the roll, and if you
 successfully evade, you're allowed to counterattack them
 with your invent as a reflexive action, costing you no turns
 in the round. They can declare a defense as normal. If you
 are succesfully grabbed, then you can't use your invent and
 it counts against the once-per-two-rounds usage limit.
 (5 points) Easy Blow
 With this your invent puts less strain on your body, enabling
 you to fight longer withoug being winded from using your full
 power. The invent costs 1 less Endurance. This can be
 purchased an unlimited number of times, but your Invent can
 not cost less than 1 Endurance.

Shield Inventions
 Shield Invents function like normal Auras that you might
 have, such as Aura of Protection. However, to create a Shield
 Invent, you must purchase at least one rank of Shield Level.
 Unlike Aura of Protection, it does not begin reflexively and so
 cannot be used after a failed defense until upgraded. You do
 not need to declare the shield level publically when a shield
 invent is used. You must have the Aura of Protection power to
 create a Shield Invent.
 Special Abilities
 (20 points) Shield Level
 This alters the shield level multiplier, which has the effect of
 reducing more damage for less Ki Cost - making it more
 efficient. Each shield level stops 1 damage, up to a maximum
 of Shield level 5. You must have a minimum Shield level of 1
 to create a Shield Invent. Template: [shield level25your level]
 Damage stopped Template: [25*your level] Ki Cost
 (10 points) Increased Limit
 This allows you to reduce more damage using your shield
 invent, albeit by using more of your energy to do so. For every
 10 points spent, you can spend 1 more point of ki per level.
 This can be purchased an unlimited number of times. Shields
 begin at 25 ki per level, before taking this upgrade.
 (50 points) Reflexive
 Increases the Ki cost by 50% This ability means you can
 use your shield to protect yourself even after you fail your
 defense (dodge or parry). Handy for people who prefer to
 avoid damage outright and wish to enjoy a safety net.
 Template: [limityour level1.5] Ki Cost

 stop damage which is specifically meant to pierce shields.
 Shield Piercing effects no longer bypass the defenses
 offered by your personal Shield. Template: [limityour

 (25 points per Shield Level) Flaring
 Your shield is either reflective or bounces back when struck.
 Whatever the method, when you use your Shield invent to
 prevent the damage from a Hand to Hand or Sword attack,
 you can return 20% of the damage you shielded, back to the
 attacker as Unpreventable damage. This damage cannot be
 dodged, parried or blocked, as it's an instantaneous return.
 Even if the Attack was UP, Flaring can be used providing the
 ki cost for stopping damage (even if no damage is stopped) is
 paid.

 Stat Booster Inventions
 Statboosters are something perhaps alien to most
 Dragonball Fans, they can represent a transformation of
 power that a race might not normally get or a technique such
 as Kaioken being used. These techniques improve rapidly
 over time, gaining a snowball effect per level you aquire and
 at later levels.
 To create a Statbooster, you take your invent points and
 divide them by 7. You have that many stat points to split
 between your STR, MNT, DEX, STM and SPD (never Int).
 Androids instead divide their Invent Points by 9. Your highest
 stat bonus may not be more than 10 points higher than your
 lowest stat bonus. INT never counts for this purpose.
 I.E. If your Statbooster grants +10 MNT and +10 SPD, you
 need to raise STR, STM and DEX by 1 before you increase
 MNT or SPD.
 Statboosters cost 1 END per 4 points added to your stats.
 NOTES ABOUT STATBOOSTERS
 You can only use a Stat Booster once per battle.
 You can not use a Stat Booster preround, only by spending
 an action.
 You can not raise your INT with a Stat Booster.
 Stat Boosters are not compatible with other Superforms.
 Increases in stats will result in increases to secondary
 attributes, such as HP, End, Ki, APR, Shield HP, etc. That
 is handled the same as it is for Superforms.

Weapon Inventions
 Weapon Attack Inventions function like most sword attacks,
 though they are heavily modified by the user to produce a
 desired effect. They can be attacks that cut through any
 defenses or make your own attacks easier on your body, while
 slashing up your opponent. To create a Weapon Invention,
 you decide on the dice type you wish to use. You may not
 change this choice later, so pick carefully. You must have the
 Thrust power to make a Sword Invent and you must buy at
 least one dice, before applying special properties. Remember
 that unlike other attack invents, you still use your base sword
 dice. Your attack must also cost a minimum of 1 Endurance.

 Increases the End cost by 1 per 3 times taken
 Increases the Ki Cost by 5% per time taken You practice
 with your technique to the point of memorizing the motion
 and speeding up its execution, enabling you to strike
 faster, leaving them no time to react. You can take this
 add-on a maximum of 15 times. Each time the upgrade is
 taken, your invent gains a +1 Strike bonus. The Strike
 bonus applies only to the last strike in a Multi Attack
 Invent.
 (15 points per die) Ki Infused
 Increases the Ki cost of every added die by 5 You can now
 channel your energy into your attack, enabling you to deal
 much more damage than normal. The invent damage die
 (not weapon dice/ki enhance dice) of your attack is now
 10 (1d810, etc). In addition, all bonuses to Ki damage are
 added to your invent. This addition costs 15 invent points
 per damage die your invent has.
 Notes: If you increase the invent dice but do not add
 enough Ki Enhancement to cover every die, none of them are
 10, the normal ki cost from this addon is still in effect, and
 the entire ki cost of the invent is increased by 50%. This does
 not allow for Ki-Strike bonuses to be applied to the attack
 strike. This does not allow Races which have damage to "all"
 to apply this racial twice.
 (150 points) Auto Critical
 Must have 4d4 or 4d8 damage die to purchase this add-on
 Increases the End cost by 1 per die
 Increases the Ki Cost by 25%
 Multi-Attack can not be taken with this add-on. Your attack
 is lethal, cutting through those that are foolish enough to
 get hit by it. Your attack becomes Auto Critical, meaning if
 it does any damage, it inflicts a level one critical effect.
 Because it's a Sword, it means the critical effect is applied
 before damage, making the damage Unpreventable. When
 you roll to determine the effect of the critical, you add +10
 to your d100 roll (which applies only to the level one
 critical chart).
 (250 points) Double Auto Critical
 Must have 8d4 or 8d8 damage die to purchase this add-on
 Increases the End cost by 2 per die
 Increases the Ki cost by 50%
 Must have the Auto Critical addon.
 Multi-Attack can not be taken with this add-on. Your attack
 is especially deadly, hacking people apart with a single
 blow. Your attack becomes Double Auto Critical, meaning
 if it does any damage, it inflicts a level two critical effect.
 Because it's a Sword, it means the critical effect is applied
 before damage, making the damage Unpreventable.
 (40 points) Bleeding Cut
 Increases the Ki cost by 20% Injuries sustained by your
 attack have trouble closing, and continue to bleed out long
 after the attack has been inflicted. Your attack now has the
 effect of Bleeding, which is fully described in Advanced
 Combat.
 (75 points) Multi-Attack
 Increases the End cost by 3 per strike
 AC and DAC can not be taken with this add-on With this
 add-on, you cut your opponent down with a flurry of steel,
 hacking them apart with a thousand little cuts instead of a
 single cleaving blow. This adds (level/3) extra strikes to
 your invent, which are performed before the final blow. A
 separate strike roll is used for each attack, though they all
 gain the bonus of one Superspeed and the invent's
 Accuracy, which is only paid for once. Bulk Damage and
 the bonus Invent Damage is only applied on the last hit.
 (5 points) Light Blade
 With this your invent puts less strain on your body, enabling
 you to fight longer withoug being winded from using your full
 power. The invent costs 1 less Endurance. This can be
 purchased an unlimited number of times, but your Invent can
 not cost less than 1 Endurance.

 owers
 owers are abilities beyond simple attacks that
 all fighters in the NeoDBZ universe may learn.
 Each power belongs to a different 'power tree,'
 which is a general classification of what exactly
 the power does. This node includes rules which
 apply to all powers in this section.
 Picking Powers
 At creation, no more than half your starting powers can be
 put into a single power tree. When you level up, you can't pick
 multiple powers from the same tree unless stated otherwise.
 If you gain a power from a school/racial feature/unique and
 you already know it, you can learn a different power from the
 same tree, but must follow the standard power rules. If you
 already have all the powers from that tree, you instead gain
 nothing.
 Roleplaying Powers
 Do not roleplay ki attacks as hand to hand or sword attacks
 (or vice-versa), or being able to read minds with telekinetic
 powers.
 Besides that, all powers can be roleplayed however you
 want, but please keep it within reason, you should not
 roleplay a multifireball as a single blast, or a regular block as
 a complete negation of an attack. Failure to follow reason will
 likely get you ridiculed by fellow players, but don't be afraid to
 ask for guidance if you think you need it.
 Power Format
 The format this section lists powers are as follows:
 Power Name: The name of the power you're using. Level:
 This is the level of the power, see below for details. Type:
 One, two, or three, see below for details. Cost: How much Ki
 and/or Endurance the power costs. Please remember that all
 powers cost 1 End, even if it isn't listed. The only exceptions
 to this rule are powers which restore Endurance. UPR: (Uses
 Per Round) The number of times you can use the power in a
 given round. If it states 1/Round, it means you can use it once
 in any round, but never twice. If it says 1/2 Rounds, it means
 if you use it one round, you can't use it the next, but on the
 round after that, you may use it again (once). Description:
 Details on what the power does and/or what it typically
 would be roleplayed as. Template: The mathematics of the
 power, typically showing the damage it does, if it does any. If
 the Template and the Description contradict, use the power's
 description and inform a GM of it, so it can be fixed in future
 updates.
 Table of
 Contents
 Power Levels
 Powers within each tree are divided into several levels: 1, 2, 3,
 X, X2, and Z.
 Level 1 powers can be taken anytime, and have no
 prerequisites.
 Level 2 powers require you have a level 1 power from the
 same tree.
 Level 3 powers require you have a level 2 power from the
 same tree.
 Level X powers require you to have all level 1, 2, and 3
 powers from the same tree.
 Level X2 powers require you to have all level 1, 2, 3, and X
 powers from the same tree.
 Level Z powers require you to have all other powers
 within the tree before you take them.
 Power Types
 Type One powers are powers which are considered to be
 either offensive or extremely strong. This is the only type of
 power which can sometimes cause you to take EXP penalties
 if they are used too early in battles. Type Two powers are
 considered neutral, they can be used both offensively and
 defensively, or do some sort of supportive function. Type
 Three powers are considered to be defensive or passive
 powers.
 Racial Powers
 Racial powers and superforms always cost a power unless it
 specifically states otherwise in the power description. Racial
 powers do not count as a power tree, so you can spend as
 many powers as you wish in your racial tree as you level, as
 long as you meet the requirements to do so.

 how to expand the size of your blasts to hit your targets
 easier. It is a passive skill which gives you a +1 strike bonus
 for every 50 ki you have spent on a ki power attack,

 you are able to release it on your third. The third action is
 used to fire the blast and does NOT add to the damage. You

 dodge or parry. This attack may not be fired unless charged
 for two actions. The two actions charging the attack add to
 the damage of the large burst. You may not use any

 Power Name: Kienzan
 Level: X2
 Type: One
 Cost: 10 End + 200 Ki
 UPR: 1/Battle
 Description: This is an especially dangerous attack with a
 disc-shaped blast, which can slice through almost anything
 and your opponent can tell. This attack requires you charge
 Ki in order to form the disc while taking up a horseshoe
 stance. It takes two actions of charging to fully form and
 attack with and thrown on the third. While charging, you can
 block and use auras and shields but if you take even a single
 point of damage, you're interrupted and must start over.
 Being interrupted does not count against uses per battle until
 it is actually thrown as an attack.
 It deals 1d6*10 damage per 3 levels of the user. It is an
 Armor Piercing, Unpreventable, Triple Auto Critical Sharp
 attack. The actions spent charging add no additional damage
 to this attack and you may not regen ki on these actions. The
 Strike roll for this attack is considered a Ki attack with a -5
 penalty. Superspeeds can not be used with this power and
 this power can not be parried.

Power Name: Master Ki Combo
 Level: Z
 Type: One
 Cost: Half of your current END + Ki Cost of powers used.
 UPR: 1/Battle
 Description: This power is the ultimate attack for any Ki user.
 You fire a Multi Fireball at twice the normal amount of
 fireballs (Which counts as two uses of Multi Fireball for that
 round), followed by two Slicing Blasts (consuming their UPR)
 and ending with any Ki invent you know (can't be a Guild
 invent).
 You can not charge into the Ki invent you use and you can't
 charge up the Ki to pay for it. If it normally is a Charging
 invent, it suffers the normal +50% Ki cost for using it without
 charging. None of the powers or invents used in this attack
 can crit, but may autohit or be AP/SP as normal on a natural
 roll of 20.
 The powers used count toward their uses per round and
 you can't choose to cancel out part of this attack. You must do
 all attacks and you must have all the powers required in order
 to use it. All powers in this Combo hit the same person and
 may not be split.
 The End loss from this power can not be altered by any
 powers or racial abilities. You roll a single Ki strike roll for all
 of the attacks. If this power hits, the victim automatically
 loses their next action.
 Power Name: Superior Enlarged Ki Blast
 Level: Z
 Type: Three
 UPR: Passive
 Description: This power is similar to Enlarged Ki Blast,
 except that it applies to Ki Invents, not Ki powers. Any Ki
 invent you fire is larger than before, and gains +1 to its Strike
 roll for every 100 Ki you spent on it, maximum of level/2. The
 Ki gained from charging into the invent doesn't count
 towards this, and anything which adds or alters the Ki cost of
 your invent (like Android's Hell's flash models, and PKU) do
 not change this bonus in any way. This bonus does not apply
 to Racial powers.

 Power Name: Ki Shield

 attacks. This shield has no cost to use, and has (your
 MNT)*10 HP. Once its HP is reduced to 0, it can not block
 anymore damage and is unusable the remainder of the battle.
 Because it's more like a form of armor for Ki than an actual
 aura, it is affected by Armor Piercing attacks, meaning half
 the damage goes to the shield, and have the damage goes to
 your HP. This shield is not reflexive, and can not be used after
 a failed dodge or parry. You must use this shield to its full
 effect whenever you use it. This is a Ki Shield, and as such is
 only able to reduce damage from Ki attacks.

 fall unconcious with 0 HP, END, and KI and may not increase

 the fight in which it is used. You can't use ki's ending on an
 attack if you aren't in the initiative.

 per level. It prevents even SP damage. Using Soul Barrier

 your only active defense.

 you've learned how to protect your body using your Ki at the
 same time. You can use auras and shields when you choose
 to block. You can not dodge when you use this power, and

 single aura or shield to reduce an attack's damage. If you

 Cost: 3 End, 4 End for a Multi
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: When someone attacks you with an offensive ki
 blast (be it from the Offensive Ki tree, racial ability, or invent),
 you can try to parry the ki attack with your hands. You can
 roleplay it as whatever you like (within reason), but the effect
 is the same. Roll a Hand to Hand strike roll, using your STR
 Modifier in place of your DEX Modifier, with a -5 penalty to
 your roll. You can choose to parry multi attacks and combos,
 but you take an additional -5 penalty to the strike roll.
 You can also choose to parry non-multi, non-combo attacks
 back at the attacker, but you take an additional -2 penalty to
 your strike roll. If you successfully parry the attack back, you
 must pay half the Ki the attack spent in the attack. If they
 choose to try and parry or dodge the attack, they use your
 parry blast roll as the roll they have to beat, you don't roll a
 new strike roll. If you rolled a 20 on the blast, it automatically
 hits and is AP/SP, but does not inflict a critical hit (because
 the 20 was on the Parry Blast, not the attack itself). The End
 Cost only happens once per action, not matter how many
 parry rolls you make or succeed.
 Power Name: Ignore Pain
 Level: X
 Type: Three
 UPR: Passive

 effect once taken. Anytime you receive a critical hit, you lose
 no actions due to the pain, and any penalties to Strike and
 Dodge are halved, rounded up. The stunned actions from a

 reduced by this power. Other stunning effects are not
 prevented, this power only negates the actions lost due to the
 pain of critical effects.

 metabolism for a short amount of time; instantly recovering
 while tiring yourself out as your body is put on overdrive. You
 lose 20% of your Maximum Endurance, but in exchange you
 regain 15% of your Maximum Hp and Ki. This can only be
 done once per battle and takes an action. The Endurance lost
 from this ability can not be altered by any abilities or powers.

 the HP gain.

 effect once taken. Your body is especially resilient against
 damage, you gain STR/2 or level*3 Resistance - whichever is
 higher.

 your Resistance would become STR*3/4.

 Description: Adept Block is an advanced form of the Power
 Block power. Your defensive stance is much improved and

 (Str+Spd)/2. If you roll a 1 on the strike roll of this attack, it
 automatically hits and becomes AP/SP, but does not inflict a
 crit. If an opponent rolls a 20 when you roll a 1, treat it as
 normal opposing natural 20s.

 Power Name: Roundhouse Kick

 the front of your foot against the opponent's body. This attack
 deals (2d8+Str/4)(3+level/2) damage to your opponent,
 always using your STR/4 as its modifier, even if you have a
 better STR modifier for damage.

Power Name: Hand to Hand Parry
 Level: 3
 Type: Three
 Cost: 2 End, 3 End for a Multi attack
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: With this power you're able to use some part of
 your body to push, stop, or redirect the armed or unarmed
 attack of another fighter. This is done by rolling a Hand to
 Hand Strike roll with a -3 penalty, with an additional -5 if
 you're trying to parry a Multi attack or a Weapon attack. If
 you're trying to parry a Multi weapon attack, you incur both
 penalties, for a total penalty of -13 (3+5+5). Combos are
 always considered multiattacks for the purposes of this.
 You do not gain any form of bonus by the way you roleplay
 your parry, using your elbows exlusively to parry would not
 grant you the +5 to strike Elbows receive. You always use
 your normal Dex modifier for this roll, just like a Hand to
 Hand strike, Red Reptiles are therefore allowed to use Dex/4,
 while everyone else uses Dex/5. If you successfully parry, your
 opponent loses 1 End per two levels you have. The End Cost
 and End Loss only happens once per action, not matter how
 many parry rolls you make or succeed.
 Power Name: Shoryuken
 Level: X
 Type: One

 knocks your opponent airborn. You deal 1d610 damage, plus
 1d610 per two levels, plus (STR+STM2). Androids use STR2
 instead of normal, for this.

 Power Name: Advanced Combo
 Level: X2
 Type: One
 Cost: 6 End + ( Cost of the powers used )
 UPR: 1/2 Rounds
 Description: This is a furious assault of multiple attacks in a
 single action. You perform a Multi Punch, Multi Kick, or a
 Shoryuken, followed by any Hand to Hand attack which isn't
 a Multi or an Invent, and end with a Slicing Attack. Pound
 can be used as the second attack of this combo if Shoryuken
 is used as the first attack.
 None of the attacks used can score a crit, and you roll only
 a single Strike roll. The powers used count toward their uses
 per round, and you can't choose to cancel out part of this
 attack. You must do all attacks, and you must have all the
 powers required in order to use it.
 Power Name: Close Quarters Mastery
 Power Level: X2
 Power Type: Three
 Power Cost: 1 Endurance per +1 Strike bonus
 Uses Per Round: Preround
 Power Description: This power hones a person's strike,
 allowing them to clearly see where their opponent is moving.
 By activating this power preround it will grant a bonus of
 1+level/3 to all Hand to Hand strikes This costs one
 endurance per bonus it grants and lasts for the entire round.
 However, this does not affect parries, or swords.
 *Template: 1d20+DEX mod+1+level/3+misc mods
 Power Name: Pound
 Level: X2
 Type: One
 Cost: 4 End + Superspeed cost
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: This power is usable only after someone has
 been hit by a Uppercut, Power Punch, Flying Ram,
 Shoryuken, Slicking Attack, Jumpkick or when used in
 Ultimate Combo. If an opponent was hit by one of those
 attacks and has yet to have had an action and hasn't been
 Pounded already, you can use this power against them. In a
 team fight you may pound an opponent that was launched by
 an ally providing it is your action to do so.
 This is an attack which uses the moment of disorientation
 and knockback (or up) caused by the listed powers to give you
 to a chance to speed around behind them and slam them into
 the ground. This attack has a -2 penalty to its Strike roll and
 requires the use of a Superspeed power (Combat Teleport or
 any advanced version of it). If it hits, you deal 4d6 damage,
 plus the damage the target took from the attack which sent
 them airborn (after damage reduction). If this power hits and
 deals damage to the target, they are stunned for their next
 action.
 When used in an Ultimate Combo, hold off rolling this
 attack damage until you know how much damage they
 recieved from either the Roundhouse, Shoryuken or
 Uppercut.
 Example: Gohan Uppercuts Cell and rolls 1000 points of
 damage. After all reductions, Cell takes 450 points of
 damage. Gohan's next action is before Cell's, so he uses
 pound and hits. He then adds the 450 damage Cell took from
 the Uppercut to the damage of this power.

Power Name: Ultimate Combo
 Level: Z
 Cost: Half your current endurance + Ki costs of the powers
 used.
 UPR: 1/Battle
 Description: This is the ultimate combination of attacks for a
 Hand to Hand fighter, usually used as a last-ditch effort to end
 a fight.
 This is a series of attacks that begins with a Multi-Punch, a
 MultiKick or an invent. Followed by a Roundhouse,
 Shoryuken, or Uppercut dealing (1d6+Str mod)*10 damage
 instead of normal. This is then followed by a Pound and then
 chasing them into the crator to finish them with a Slicing
 attack. Finally to ensure the body is destroyed, they end it all
 with any Ki power level three or below which isn't a Ki
 Combo.
 The powers used count toward their uses per round and
 you can't choose to cancel out part of this attack. You must do
 all attacks and you must have all the powers required in order
 to use it. None of the powers or invents used in this attack
 can crit, but may autohit or be AP/SP as normal on a natural
 roll of 20.
 The End loss from this power can not be altered by any
 powers or racial abilities. You roll a single Hand to Hand
 strike roll for all of the attacks, including the Ki attack. If this
 power hits, the victim automatically loses their next action.
Flight
 Flying is really just a very basic form of telekinesis, however,
 using the energy to stay in flight for long durations requires
 special adaptations and thus you cannot fly with telekinetic
 powers.
 Flight in combat
 If you are flying and the opponent you are attacking is not,
 you recieve a +2 mobility bonus to all strike and dodge rolls
 until your opponent activates flight. If you are flying an your
 opponent is not, they must use a superspeed to be able to
 reach you with a sword or hand to hand attack.
 Power Name: Basic Flight
 Level: 1
 Type: Two
 Cost: 5 Ki per hour (Round in Combat) UPR: Preround
 Description: With this power you can fly through the air. You
 can fly up to your (SPD*5) MPH. This power must be
 declared as a preround action if you choose to use it during
 combat.
 Power Name: Advanced Flight
 Level: 2
 Type: Two
 Cost: 10 Ki per hour (Round in Combat)
 UPR: Preround
 Description: This power is just an improved form of flying.
 You can fly up to your (SPD*10) MPH. This power must be
 declared as a preround action if you choose to use it during
 combat.
 Power Name: Damaging Aura
 Level: X
 Type: Two
 Cost: 4 End + 50 Ki
 UPR: Preround
 Description: With this power, you can create an aura around
 your body, empowering your Hand to Hand attacks with your
 speed. This causes all of your Hand to Hand attacks to deal
 an additional 10% damage, halved for multiattacks and
 combos. This bonus damage applies to all damage except for
 Bulk (and things which act like it), and does not apply to just
 the base dice and Strength modifier like normal. This bonus
 damage applies only to Hand to Hand attacks, including
 Grapple Moves, but not for Swords.

 Power Name: Boosted Flight
 Level: X2
 Type: Two
 Cost: 3 End + 20 Ki + Additional Ki Cos (Round in Combat)
 UPR: Preround
 Description: This power is a mastered form of Flight. For its
 base cost, you can fly up to your (SPD15) MPH. You can
 boost your flight speed above this amount, to a maximum of
 your (SPD30) MPH, by paying 1 Ki per 10 MPH above your
 SPD15 you wish to go. If your SPD15 was 2000 MPH, and
 you wanted to go 4000 MPH, you would need to pay 220 Ki
 and 3 End per round you maintained it.
 Power Name: Space Flight
 Level: Z
 Type: Two
 Cost: 200 or 500 Ki per hour (Round in Combat)
 UPR: Cannot be used in Combat
 Description: This power allows you to travel through space,
 going 1 Light Year per hour, per 100 Spd you have. It costs
 200 Ki per hour if you can survive in space naturally (a racial
 feature), or 500 Ki per hour if you can't.
 This power can't be used in combat and anyone that
 engages in combat that can't survive in space will spend 10
 extra End per action (even when using Rest or Rejuvenation)
 and die in two rounds if they don't get their Space Flight
 activated again within that time.
 This power can be used to survive intolerable
 environments. A protective globe of force will surround the
 character so that they can survive underwate, in lava, and
 other extremes of temperature. The cost is still the same, but
 it can be activated during combat in this way only. It doesn't
 prevent damage in combat, even if it is based on fire or cold.
 It still can't be turned on during combat in outer space,
 however.
 *This power requires you to have 60 MNT to use it.

Ki Body Enhancement
 When using any of the Bulking powers (including Bulking
 Aura), you can only add the Bulk into an action once. So if
 you use a Combo, you can only add Bulk to one attack, which
 is always the last attack that could be bulked, unless the
 power specifically states otherwise. In an Ultimate Combo,
 for example, your final attack is a Ki attack, so you add your
 Bulk to the last Hand to Hand attack in the combo.
 Bulk damage is added at the end of an attack, and is not
 multiplied by anything, except in the case of Sword Criticals.
 Power Name: Bulk-up
 Level: 1
 Type: One
 Cost: 15 Ki per +mod Damage, maximum of 15 Ki/level
 UPR: Once per action
 Description: With this power, you can channel your Ki into
 your muscles, enhancing your Hand to Hand or Sword
 damage for one action. Your opponent always knows when
 you're using this power, and you must declare it when you
 perform the attack, before they declare their defense. You
 gain + (SPD/5 for Swords or Str/5 for H2h) damage per 15
 Ki spent, with a maximum of 15 Ki/level.

 Cost: 5 Ki per +5 Damage, maximum of 5 Ki/level
 UPR: Preround
 Description: This power adds a small but constant amount of
 damage to all of your Hand to Hand and Sword attacks for an
 entire round. This power is usable only as a preround action,
 and can not be done during the round. This power works like
 a Bulk power in all ways, except that it can be used with other
 Bulk powers. This damage is still not multiplied by anything,
 only added once in a combo situation and does not apply to
 grapple-only special moves.

 with a Multiattack.

 Description: This power allows you to enhance a non-invent,
 non-combo Hand to Hand or Sword attack of level X2 or
 below to bypass almost all forms of energy barriers. The
 attack becomes Unpreventable, but may not benefit from
 other Ki Body Enhancement powers (even Bulking Aura).
 This doubles the END cost of the modified attack, in addition
 to a 200 Ki surcharge. The +100% END cost is applied
 before any other modifiers to the END cost

Powering Up
 A character can only Charge up to his level*3 times per
 battle. A 10th level character, for example, could charge 30
 times in a battle. You can never charge more than this.
 Everyone has three 'pools' of Ki: Their normal Ki pool,
 which is where your normal amount of Ki is kept. This is the
 only Ki pool which can regenerate, and it can not go above
 100% of your normal, Maximum Ki. Your second Ki pool is
 your 'Charging' pool, which can keep up to another 100% of
 your normal, Maximum Ki in it, which is filled by any of the
 Charging powers, except for Mega Charge. Lastly you have
 your Mega Charge pool, which can never have more than
 50% of your normal, Maximum Ki. Even if you havethe power
 Chi Overflow, the maximum for this pool is 50%, you simply
 can fill it twice.
 Note again that your normal Ki pool is the only pool of Ki
 which can regenerate. Any Ki regeneration you have never
 applies to any other Ki pool.
 Power Name: Charge
 Level: 1
 Type: Two
 Cost: 1 End
 UPR: Unlimited, Counts against your maximum charges per
 battle Description: This power allows a character to collect
 Ki from their surroundings for their own use. Each action
 spent using this power, or any advanced version of it, counts
 toward your your maximum charges per battle. This power
 gives you Mnt/2 Ki per action you use it, and Ki gained this
 way is added to your Charging pool.
 Power Name: Enhanced Charge
 Level: 2
 Type: Two
 Cost: 1 End
 UPR: Unlimited, Counts against your maximum charges per

 Power Name: Flare
 Level: X
 Type: Two
 Cost: 2 or 5 End
 UPR: Unlimited, Counts against your maximum charges per
 battle Description: You can use the power High Charge to
 immediately and violently expel your gathered Ki around you,
 instead of adding it to your Charging pool. This attack can not
 be parried. It deals an amount of damage equal to your
 (Charged Ki + all Ki damage modifiers)/4. This damage is
 considered Unpreventable, and costs 2 End to use.
 You can also use this with the power Mega Charge, but you
 take a -4 penalty to your Ki strike roll because of the time it
 takes to gather so much energy, and it costs 5 End instead.
 However, this flare is so powerful it affects everyone in
 combat except the user. Template: [(Charged Ki + Mnt Mod +
 Misc mods)/4] UP
 Notes:
 This power can also be used to break free of a grapple, but
 in such cases does not do damage. The usage of this
 power for that purpose is listed in the Grappling section of
 Combat.
 Power Name: Mega Charge

 Type: Two
 Cost: 1 End
 UPR: 1/Battle, Counts against your maximum charges per

 also be used defensively with a shield invent or soul barrier to
 absorb more damage.

Super Speed
 Superspeed powers last for the entire action you use it in. If
 you make multiple strike or dodge rolls in that action, you
 add it to all of them, with the exception of Remoted attacks.
 Notes:
 Powers and Uniques which give a single burst to strike
 and/or dodge are not active for the full action like
 Superspeeds, and that Counters are considered a
 separate action, and thus don't gain the benefit of the
 Superspeed use in the action the Counter was gained.
 None of the below powers are actual 'Teleports', it's just
 semantics. If something states the only things that
 enhance a strike or dodge roll are teleports, Superspeeds
 do not apply.
 Power Name: (CT) Combat Teleport
 Level: 1
 Type: Two
 Cost: 10 Ki
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: This allows a character to move faster than they
 normally could for a short period. It is not an actual teleport,
 but a burst of speed which makes them difficult to see. You
 use this power to enhance an attack or defense, it does not
 take an action to perform. It grants a +2 to Strikes and
 Dodges by spending 10 Ki, but requires you to have 20 Speed
 to use.
 Power Name: (ACT) Advanced Combat TeleportPower Name:
 (ACT) Advanced Combat Teleport
 Level: 2

 by spending 30 Ki, but requires you to have 40 Speed to use.
 Power Name: (MCT) Multi-Combat Teleport
 Level: 3
 Type: Two
 Cost: 2 end + 75 Ki
 UPR: 1/Round
 Description: This power allows you to have several shorter,
 but powerful bursts of speed, as opposed to CT and ACT's
 single burst, allowing better maneuverability. It grants you a
 (1d4+1+SPD/15) bonus to Strikes and Dodges, rounded
 down, and it is the number of bursts you do. This power
 requires you to have 60 Speed to use.

 Description: This is very similar to MCT, but with several
 bursts equivalent to an Advanced Combat Teleport, instead of
 just a Combat Teleport. It grants you a (1d6+1+SPD/10)
 bonus to Strikes and Dodges, rounded down, and it is the
 number of bursts you do. This power requires you to have 70
 Speed to use.

 Power Name: Zanzoken
 Level: X2
 Type: Two
 Cost: 5 end + 100 Ki
 UPR: 2/2 Rounds (Twice per two rounds) Description: This
 power allows you to create a fake copy of yourself, which
 tricks your opponent into attacking (or defending against) you
 where you used to be, allowing you to burst around and strike
 them while they're distracted, or get away from an oncoming
 attack. This power is usable 2/2 Rounds, which means you
 could use it twice in one round, but then none the next, or
 once in each round. You can use this power to reroll a failed
 Strike or Dodge, but instead of any Superspeed you originally
 used, you add your SPD/10 to the roll instead. When you
 activate Zanzo you lose your prievous superspeed and strike
 additions (Tact Sac, IT, Kai kai, Zero Shift, Rampage, Mystic
 Attack, etc). You also may not modify the new strike with any
 of the prievous abilitys. You may use this power twice on the
 same strike or dodge roll.
 Power Name: Graceful
 Level: Z
 Type: Three
 UPR: Passive
 Description: After time, you have learned to hone your speed
 more effectively, causing all of your dodges to be that much
 better. Add your SPD/50 to all dodge rolls.
 This is dodge only, not strike. Also, this bonus does not
 apply against Telekinetic Attacks.
 72
Sword
 These powers are usable with all standard weapons in the
 PHB, even if they are not roleplayed as swords.
 Sword Combos work differently than other types of
 Combos and roll a separate strike roll for each attack made
 in the Combo. If a Superspeed is used with or against a
 Sword combo, it applies to all Strikes and all Defenses made.
 They are still considered Combos, however, and as such,
 auras and shields used against them can still only be used
 against a single attack made in the combo, though it can
 apply to all strikes of a specific attack. If you chose to Power
 Block a Sword combo, you could use Supreme Aura against
 all of the Multislash damage rolls, but you would have to use
 a different aura against the Twice damages.
 Power Name: Thrust
 Level: 1
 Type: One
 Cost: 3 End
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: You lunge with your body, and attempt to impale
 your opponent with your blade. You take a -3 penalty to Strike

 Power Name: Slice
 Level: 2
 Type: One
 Cost: 2 End. 5 End + 25 Ki for the UP version
 UPR: Unlimited, 1/Round
 Description: This is a clean sweep of your blade against an
 opponent. This power adds Shield Piercing to the attack, but
 offers no additional damage.
 Alternatively, if you're using a sword which is inherently
 Shield Piercing, you may use a different form of Slice once
 per round. This version makes your damage Unpreventable,
 but costs 5 End and 25 Ki, instead of the usual cost. You
 must declare the usage of this UP Slice when you use this
 version.
 Power Name: Twice
 Level: 3
 Type: One
 Cost: 3 End
 UPR: 2/Round
 Description: You perform a quick circle-eight motion with
 your weapon, slashing twice against an opponent in a single
 action. Strikes and damages are rolled separately for each
 strike.
 The first attack made has a -3 penalty to its strike roll, but
 the second attack gains a +3 bonus to its strike roll. Both
 strikes made can crit. Separate defenses can be made
 against each attack, but Superspeeds used with or against
 this power apply to both strikes, and attempting to parry the
 strikes made using this power does not incur a Multi attack
 penalty.
 Bulk is applied only to the second attack made in a Twice,
 and can not be applied to both strikes. 1st Strike Template:

 Power Name: Ki Enhance
 Level: 3
 Type: Two
 Cost: 15 Ki per +1d10 base damage, up to 15 Ki per level
 UPR: Preround
 Description: Using this power, you can channel your Ki into
 your weapon, making it a little sharper, stronger, and more
 durable. This power can only be activated preround, and lasts
 for the entire round when used. It grants any eligable weapon
 you wield +2 to all Sword strikes made in the round, and adds
 1d10 to the base damage of the sword per level you have,
 costing 15 Ki per +1d10 damage. This power must be used at
 max ki cost to gain the strike bonus.
 This power has a unique ability, giving you the option of
 dispelling the energy infused into your weapon as a blast of
 Ki. This is considered a Ki attack, using your Ki strike for its
 strike roll, and deals 1d810 damage per die you added to your
 weapon. Damage which applies to sword does not enhance
 this damage, but bonuses to Ki damage do. Dispell Template:

Power Name: Multi Slash
 Level: X
 Type: One
 Cost: 1 End + 3 End per hit, up to 1 End + 3 End per 2 levels
 UPR: 1/Round
 Description: You perform a dizzying series of strikes with
 your sword in a single action. You strike once with your
 weapon, plus an additional time per two levels you have (at
 level one you'd hit once, at level two you'd hit twice, at level
 four you'd hit three times, etc). You roll strike and damage
 separately for each attack. You can only bulk into the first
 strike you make, and only the first strike can become a crit.
 Notes:
 Supreme Aura and Aura of Protection can be used
 multiple times (once per hit) against Multi Slash because
 it's a single attack, not a Combo. Its damage rolls are
 separate, however, meaning that any shield or aura which
 has a per-round limit (such as Shield Invents) can only be
 used against a single damage roll.
 The power Freeze avoids all strikes from this power.
 You can declare separate defenses against each hit of a
 Multislash, but parries suffer the usual penalty for
 attempting to parry a Multiattack (-5), which is applied to
 all parries made.
 Power Name: Parrying Strike
 Level: X
 Type: Three
 Cost: 2 End, 3 End for a Multi Attack UPR: Unlimited
 Description: This power allows you to use your sword
 defensively to catch, knock away, or stop an an opponent's
 armed or unarmed attack. You make a normal Sword strike
 with a -3 penalty, with an additional -5 penalty for Multi
 attacks. Swords can parry other Swords and Hand to Hand
 attacks, and suffer no additional penalty for parrying Hand to
 Hand attacks. If you succeed, your opponent loses 1 End per
 two levels you have. The End Cost and End Loss only
 happens once per action, not matter how many parry rolls
 you make or succeed.
 Power Name: Perfect Strike
 Level: X
 Type: One
 Cost: 8 End + Lose last action of the round
 UPR: 1/Round
 Description: This is a graceful, deadly attack of finesse,
 striking at an opponent's vulnerabilities. You deal twice your
 sword's maximum damage. Using this power makes you lose
 the last action in the round, however if you use it as your last
 action of the round, you do not lose any action of the next
 round. This attack does not gain any sort of Bulk damage.

 shreds, slicing them limb from limb. You perform a Multi
 Slash, and then a Twice. None of the attacks used can score a
 crit. The powers used count toward their uses per round, and
 you can not choose to cancel out part of this attack. You must
 do all attacks, and you must have all the powers required in
 order to use it.

 This is a Combo, but a separate strike roll is made for
 every hit of the Multi Slash and the Twice, and as such
 separate defenses can be declared against each strike
 made. Parrying any of the attacks incurs the normal
 penalty for attempting to parry a Multi attack, and a parry
 roll must be made against each attack.

Power Name: Advanced Sword Combo
 Level: X2
 Type: One
 Cost: 13 End + ( Cost of the powers used )
 UPR: 1/2 Rounds
 Description: You strike with your sword and flow in a single,
 continuous motion. You perform a Multi Slash or Thrust,
 then a Twice or Perfect Strike, and end with any Offensive Ki
 power of level three or below. The Ki power hits if the last
 sword attack in the Combo hits.
 None of the attacks used can score a crit. The powers used
 count toward their uses per round, and you can't choose to
 cancel out part of this attack. You must do all attacks, and you
 must have all the powers required in order to use it. Using
 Perfect Strike incurs the normal penalty of losing your last
 action of the round.
 Notes:
 This is a Combo, but a separate strike roll is made for
 every hit of the powers you use, and as such separate
 defenses can be declared against each strike made.
 Parrying any of the attacks incurs the normal penalty for
 attempting to parry a Multi attack, and a parry roll must
 be made against each attack.
 Power Name: Ragnarok
 Level: Z
 Cost: Half of your current Endurance, rounded up.
 UPR: 1/Battle
 Description: This is one of a Sword user's deadliest attacks in
 his or her arsenal, used only to finish off an opponent when
 there is no other way. When this power is used, you
 temporarily create clones of yourself and surround your
 opponent. All of your clones move in sync with you and strike
 all at once against your target.
 2d5+2 clones are created, each of which dealing your
 regular sword damage. Your sword's base dice in damage and
 Strength modifier are multiplied by the number of clones you
 have, no other damage is multiplied by the clones. This
 attack's damage is SP, or Unpreventable if the attack's
 damage is already SP. The End loss from this power can not
 be altered by any powers or racial abilities. If this power hits,
 the victim automatically loses their next action.

Ki Awareness
 The Sense Ki and Sense Alignment powers are always active
 on a character, unless they wish it not to be. This means that
 if something occurs while they're offline--such as a
 Deathmatch, or a large battle--they still sensed it, as long as
 their Sense Ki roll has a base of 100% chance (requiring level
 five, normally).
 This also means that anytime you have a Lock on another
 character in a fight, anytime that person's powerlevel
 changes, you'd know about it. If you have a lock on someone
 in battle, you can request for them to tell you their
 Powerlevel, and they must do so, and it does not take an
 action for them to gain this knowledge.
 Notes:
 In game terms, sensing someone's powerlevel does not
 give you a number--that's what Scouters are for. Thus,
 though someone would tell you their powerlevel is
 345645, you don't know that, your character would sense
 the strength of their powerlevel relative to their own. If
 you sense someone at 100k, and you have a powerlevel of
 50k, you know that their aura is about two times that of
 yours. Similarly, if you sensed someone with a 25k
 powerlevel, you'd know their aura is about half that of
 yours. If someone was sensed at 58k, you'd know they're a
 little bit stronger than you. If you sensed someone at
 500k, your character might very well be afraid of them,
 because their aura is many times over that of your own.
 Note that you must tell someone what your powerlevel is,
 you can't describe it as 'weak' or 'strong', if their
 powerlevel was weak as well, you wouldn't seem weak to
 them, you'd seem about as strong as they are.
 If someone has sensed your aura before, they can always
 detect that you're the same person you were before. Your
 aura never changes, only the strength of your aura does as
 you grow. If someone has sensed you before, and you're
 using a different alias than your normal one, you must tell
 them who you really are.
 Power Name: Sense Ki
 Level: 1
 Type: Two
 UPR: Preround, 1/10 IRL minutes
 Description: You can detect Ki traces across the planet you're
 on. This has a base chance of 50%, +10% per level, including
 level 1. If you fail this roll, you do not realize you failed, and
 you can only sense once every 10 IRL minutes.
 You can also use this power to lock onto an opponent's Ki
 signature, making it easer to anticipate their attacks as they
 move in battle. You roll your Ki Sense at the beginning of the
 round (as a preround action), and if you succeed you gain +1
 to all Strikes and Dodges for that round. You can do this at
 the start of every round, but the bonus can not go above +10.
 If you fail to sense them you lose one lock on them, giving you-1 Strike and Dodge. It is possible to have a negative from
 this power, by gaining a false reading of their Ki, so use it
 wisely.
 Example: If Veginar succesfully locks onto his opponent for
 the first three rounds, he has +3 strike and dodge. If he fails
 his roll in the fourth round it is lowered to +2 strike and
 dodge.

 Power Name: Sense Path (Add-On to Sense Ki)
 Level: 2
 Type: Two
 UPR: Same as Sense Ki
 Power Description: Whenever you sense someone's ki, you
 also are able to detect what Path they most closely follow.
 Power Name: Suppress Power Level
 Level: 3
 Type: Two
 UPR: Preround
 Description: Using this power, you can lower your aura to
 deceive your foes, or minimize your ki usage, making it more
 efficient. As a preround action only, you can lower your
 powerlevel by 10% per level, to a maximum of 99% power
 level reduction at level ten. When suppressing your power
 level, you receive of effects per 10% suppression you use:-10% Ki used, -10% Damage dealt, -1 to all Strikes and
 Dodges. These are applied after everything: Damage
 multipliers, Cost increases/reductions, MA's checking to see
 if they get a free discharge. It is always the last effect applied.
 40% Suppression Template: [Damage Dealt.6] [Ki Cost.6]
 [Strike/Dodge-6]
 Notes:
 You can not use this power and Increase Power Level at
 the same time.
 Power Name: Hide Power Level
 Level: X
 Type: Two
 UPR: Preround
 Description: With this power, you can mask your powerlevel
 from people's attempts to sense you. When someone rolls a
 Ki Sense roll and you're hiding your powerlevel, apply a
 negative to their roll of 30%, +5% per level, including level 1.
 So at level 6, you would subtract 60% from their roll, if their
 roll becomes a negative from this reduction, they fail to sense
 you. However, even if they successfully sense you, no one can
 determine your Path as long as you continue using this
 power. You can only use this power if you are not spending Ki
 in any way (including for flying).
 Notes:
 You can use this power in combat, however if you use Ki
 in any way during the round, anyone in the combat gets a
 chance to automatically lock onto you.
 You can not use Hide Power Level and Increase Power
 Level at the same time.
 This power affects Scouters and Androids and stacks with
 bonuses from other effects, such as a Dwelling's Scouter
 Jamming or the unique Enhanced Awareness.
 76
Power Name: Transfer Power
 Level: X
 Type: Two
 Cost: 10 or 25 Ki/level
 UPR: Once per action
 Description: You can transfer some of your Ki to another
 being, as long as you can sense or touch them. If you're only
 able to sense the person, you can transfer up to 10 Ki per
 level you have in an action. If you are physically touching
 them, this goes up to 25 Ki per level. The Ki is directly
 transferred from you to them, meaning you lose as much Ki
 as you give to them.
 This ability can be used outside of combat as well.
 Power Name: Increase Powerlevel
 Level: X2
 Type: Two
 Cost: 4 END per +1 Strike / Dodge, up to 4 END +4 END per
 2 levels.
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: You bring out all of your inner strength. You may
 spend 4 END, +4 END per even level (8 END at 2, 12 END at
 4, etc). For every 4 END you spend, you increase your
 Powerlevel by 10% and gain a +1 bonus to all strikes and
 dodges for the rest of the round. This may be done as an
 action or as a preround action. If your opponent uses it as a
 preround action, you may choose to use it belatedly, before
 the first action takes place, or increase (but never decrease!)
 how much END you spend on it. Multiple uses of this power
 do not stack.
 Power Name: Universal Awareness
 Level: Z
 Type: Two
 UPR: Preround, 1/10 IRL minutes
 Description: Your ability to sense Ki signatures can now
 extend beyond the planet you're on, across huge distances.
 You can now sense up to 1 Lightyear away for every level you
 possess. However, it is harder to sense beings further away.
 For each Lightyear away your target is you gain -5%.

Telekinesis
 The bonuses that several races get to Ki damage, or all
 damage types, do not apply to Telekinetic powers. However,
 the bonuses to Ki Strikes do. The only bonus that applies to
 Telekinetic damage is the normal +Mnt mod and damages
 that refer directly to telekinetics.
 These are attacks on a person's mind, therefore anything
 which enhanced a person's speed (Superspeeds) do not work
 against them or with them. The only moves that do are
 Shunkan Idou (Instant Transmission), Kai Kai and Focused
 or similar. This is because these powers are heightening
 mental reflexes not just a physical speed boost.
 If it's called into question whether or not a power works
 with Telekinetics, consider what that power is actually doing.
 If it's just increasing the user's speed, then it does not work.
 Powers that deal damage from the telekinetics tree inflict
 Hand-to-Hand criticals on a natural twenty.
 Power Name: Telekinesis
 Level: 1
 Type: One
 Cost: 1 End + ( 5 Ki per 1d6, maximum of 25 Ki/level )
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: You can move many small objects with your
 mind, causing them to hit someone relentlessly. Or you could
 force someone to move themself in an arkward way to
 disjoint their body parts or almost anything else. Be creative.
 This power costs 5 Ki per 1d6 to a maximum of 25 Ki per
 level. This attack can not be parried or countered and
 Superspeeds can not be used with or against it.
 Template: {(1d6 per 5 Ki + Ki mod) + Misc mods}
 Power Name: Psionic Aura
 Level: 2
 Type: Three
 Cost: None
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: Using this power, you learn how to create a layer
 of force around yourself, made from your psionic prowess. It
 is considered a shield with your (MNT*2) hit points, and it
 regains MNT/2 hit points on each of your actions.
 This shield can function even if the user is unconscious,
 and will always be up unless you wish it not to be, such as if
 you choose to use a different aura or shield to stop an attack.
 This aura is reflexive, and like all auras, it can not be used
 with any kind of block except for Power Block, and can it can
 not be used more than once in a combo situation.
 Power Name: Minor ESP
 Level: 2
 Type: Two
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: You can speak to others in their minds. You must
 be able to see or sense the person to do this, and they can not
 reply to you in the same fashion unless they have Minor ESP
 and can see or sense you. For obvious reasons, no form of
 ESP can be sent/recieved while you're unconcious.

 Contents
 Power Name: Telekinetic Parry
 Level: X
 Type: Three
 Cost: 30 Ki
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: This power allows you to use your mind to
 deflect Hand to Hand and Sword attacks away from your
 body. You use your Ki strike vs. the strike roll at no penalty.
 Your attacker benefits from any superspeeds they use, but
 you can not use superspeeds with this power. You take a -4
 penalty if you try to parry a Multiattack or Combo. This
 power's Ki cost is only paid once per action, regardless of
 how many parry rolls are made.
 Power Name: Super Telekinesis
 Level: X
 Type: One
 Cost: 1 End + ( 25 Ki per 1d610, maximum of 25 Ki per level
 )
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: This power is identical to Telekinesis, except
 stronger. It deals 1d610 damage for every 25 Ki spent, with a
 maximum of 25 Ki per level, and the damage Ignores Armor.
 This power can not be parried or countered, and
 Superspeeds can not be used with or against it. Up to twice
 per round you may make this attack Shield Piercing at the
 cost of +10Level Ki.
 Template: {(1d610 per 25 Ki + Ki mod) + Misc mods} IA
 Power Name: Telekinetic Enhancement
 Level: X
 Type: Two
 Cost: 3 Ki per +2 Damage, maximum of 15 Ki/level
 UPR: Once per action
 Description: With this power you can channel additional Ki in
 to your telekinetic strikes. Your opponent always knows when
 you're using this power, and you must declare it when you use
 the enhancement, before they declare their defense. You gain
 +2 damage per 3 Ki spent, with a maximum of 15 Ki/level.
 Template: (52level) Additional Damage
 Power Name: Solid aura
 Level: X
 Type: Three
 Cost: None
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: This power replaces the power Psionic Aura,
 and is essentially a much stronger version of it. Your aura
 now has MNT*4 HP, and is now SP resistant. It functions
 exactly like Psionic Aura.
 78
Power Name: Capture Ball
 Level: X2
 Type: Two
 Cost: 1 End + ( 25 Ki + 25 Ki per three levels )
 UPR: 1/Round
 Description: With this power, you can entrap an opponent in
 a globe of psychokinetic force. You roll a Ki strike roll to do
 so, and if successful, you can hold them captive for 1+level/3
 actions, spending 25 Ki per action they're held. This power
 can not be parried or countered, and Superspeeds can not be
 used with or against it. This ability has -4 to strike.
 While they are trapped, they can not attack, be attacked,
 charge, or move. They can do only the following:
 Use a Superform/Statbooster
 Use the powers Rest, Rejuvenate, Taiyoken, or Meditation
 (Cloud school)
 If they have the powers Kai Kai or IT, they can teleport out
 of the globe, which can be done as part of their action.
 Notes:
 Capball may not be used on yourself, the energy is
 disrupted by your own ki.
 While you may increase your Superform, you may not
 lower it - the Ball prevents your energy from leaving.
 Power Name: Psionic Surge
 Level: X2
 Type: Two
 Cost: 1 End + ( 75 Ki per target )
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: Using this power, you can disrupt your
 opponent(s) ability to lock onto your Ki signature, making it
 harder for them to anticipate your movement.
 This power has a 40% chance of success, +10% per level.
 To use this power, you roll your chance of success, and your
 opponent rolls their Sense Ki roll. If you have a higher margin
 of success than they do, then you successfully disrupt your
 opponent, making them lose all their Ki lock bonuses and
 take a penalty equal to the highest Lock they had, which lasts
 for a number of rounds equal to twice the penalty. If your
 opponent had a +2 from their Ki Lock on you, they would lose
 their +2, and take a -2 penalty to all Strikes and Dodges for
 four rounds.
 Example: Shadow is level five and has psionic surge. He
 uses it against Xanadu, who is level six. Shadow's is at 90%,
 Xanadu's is 110%. Shadow rolls a twenty, giving him a 70%
 win margin on his roll. Xanadu must roll a 40 or less if he
 doesn't want to receive the penalties and only lose his lock.
 Unfortunately he rolls a 55, making his margin 55%. Xanadu
 loses the locks and receives a negative equal to the positive
 bonus he just had.
 Power Name: Freeze
 Level: Z
 Type: Three
 Cost: 4 End + 200 Ki
 UPR: 1/Battle
 Description: With this power you have gained an elementary
 grasp on how to manipulate space and time. Using this
 power, you can automatically dodge any attack. This power is
 reflexive, so you can use it even after you've failed a Dodge or
 Parry roll (but not after you have received the damage).
 This power stops everything in a Sword combo, Twice,
 Multislash, Dual-wielded attacks, etc.. The only exception to
 this rule is Ki Attacks with the Double Remote add-on, which
 can be remoted back at someone after they've used this
 power.

Hybrid Powers
 Hybrid powers are unusual in the sense that they are not
 fitted in a single category. These powers have certain
 prerequisites, but are usually not a prerequisite themselves. If
 a power lists multiple prerequisites, all of them must be met.
 Powers that have prequisites from another tree count as
 though they are from those trees, but are not prequisites
 themselves for those trees. A hybrid power might require all
 the X powers of a certain tree, but that hybrid power itself is
 not a requirement to take the X2 or Z level powers of that
 tree.
 Power Name: Taiyoken (Solar Flare)
 Prequisites: Any level 3 power of the Offensive Ki tree
 Type: Two
 Cost: 1 End + 25 Ki
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: This power allows you to generate a bright flash
 of light which can blind people. Everyone in the combat must
 roll a saving throw, unless they've never seen this power
 before; in which case they're automatically blinded. If you
 have this power, you count as having seen it before.
 To save, you roll 1d20+INT/5 with an additional +2 bonus
 for each previously made Taiyoken Save. Results higher than
 20 is a save and you shielded your eyes in time.
 If you failed your roll, you're blinded for the next two
 actions (not yours, but the first two that come next). While
 blinded, you may not perform attacks or parries, and your
 dodges receive a -8 penalty. You may perform any actions that
 are not an attack or a parry while blinded normally.
 Power Name: Ki Shaping
 Prequisites: Any level 2 power of the Offensive Ki tree and
 the power Telekinesis.
 Type: One
 Cost: 25 Ki per level to create, +10 Ki per level to swing.
 UPR: Unlimited
 Decription: You focus your Ki in or around your hand and
 shape it like a blade of pure energy by using your mind. This
 may be done as a pre-round action, and creates a weapon
 that deals 1d410 AP damage per 25 Ki spent, to a maximum
 of 25 Ki per level and has a +3 bonus to strike. You may use
 any Sword Power with it. However, every time you swing the
 blade it costs 10 Ki per 1d410 damage it inflicts. Note that in
 the case of Twice, a Multi-Slash, or similar you must spend
 the Ki for every attack in the sword multi / combo. This
 sword benefits from all bonuses to Ki Damage and Sword
 Damage, but PKU does not function with it.
 Despite its requirements, attacks with the sword count as
 sword attacks and not telekinetic attacks, so superspeeds
 may be used for and against them. The Unique Final Ki
 Attacker treats this as a Ki Attack. This attack counts as a
 Multi for purposes of interacting with +% damage.

 Power Name: Discharge Dodge
 Prequisites: The Discharge and Combat Teleport powers
 Type: Three
 Cost: 15 ki per level
 UPR: 1/Round
 Description: Insted of targetting the enemy with a ki attack,
 you project your energy as a broad burst down to the ground
 or even wider to 'push' off the thickness of the air itself. You
 don't put quite as much energy into it as you would with a ki
 attack, but it's just enough that you can shove yourself aside
 of an incoming attack. For every 15 Ki you spend, to a
 maximum of 15 ki per level, you gain a +1 bonus to Dodging
 an attack. This ki cost is unreducable except by Suppress
 Power Level and considered a Superspeed.
 Power Name: Psionic Entemperment
 Prequisites: Ki Shaping / A level 2 Telekinetic Power
 Type: One
 Cost: 2 End + ( 25 Ki per level )
 UPR: Unlimited
 Description: This power is similar to Ki Shaping and is
 simply an advanced form of it. You strike at the target and a
 blade made from your mind extend to actually deal the
 damage before dissipating. This is a Hand-to-Hand attack
 with a +3 bonus that deals 1d6*10 AP damage per 25 Ki
 spent, up to 25 Ki per level. It benefits from any bonuses to Ki
 Damage and any bonuses to HtH Damage. Despite requiring
 a Telekinetic Power, this counts as a Hand-to-Hand attack
 and not a Telekinetic Attack and Superspeeds may be used
 for and against it normally and Shield Piercing Charge
 affects it. It may not benefit from Bulk or Pku and the Unique
 Final Ki Attacker treats it as a Ki Attack. This attack counts
 as a Multi for purposes of interacting with +% damage.

 aces
 here are slight differences in each category.
 They each gain their own positives and
 negatives. Outside of these pros and cons, your
 racial category will determine their EXP chart.-=|[ Low Races ]|=
Low Races gain additions to their HP and Ki
 mods as they level up. They learn schools as they level up,
 and tend to know more schools than other racial categories.
 However, their stats and Hp/Ki modifiers start out low.
 Meaning, it can take time for these races to reach their prime.-=|[ Medium Races ]|=
Like Low Races, Medium Races gain additions to their Hp/Ki
 Mods as they level up. They, also, gain small periodic bonuses
 to all of their stats as they level. They start off with average
 stats, and tend to be more specialized than other races in
 what they do.-=|[ High Races ]|=
These races tend to have high starting stats, good Hp/Ki
 modifiers, and superforms. Those that don't have superforms
 tend to have abilities, which sometimes act like them instead.
 Due to their starting and progressive power, High Races tend
 to level slower.-=|[ Restricted Races ]|=
These races are unique in that only one of each restricted
 may exist at any given time. There are special rules for
 obtaining one, as described in their section. These tend to be
 extremely powerful and extremely rare creatures with
 abilities that either far exceed those of other races. To
 compensate for this, they level extremely slowly. They, too, get
 a bonus to powers, though not as frequently as High Races.-=|[ Super Forms ]|=
A superform is any racial feature or power that increases the
 ability of a character through a transformation.
 Transformations cannot be done pre-round unless stated
 otherwise (like Icer Form 2) and must be done during battle,
 taking actions to do so. Some superforms, such as Super
 Saiyans or Namekian Bulked Form, allow for races to
 immediately gain their forms when they take an action to do
 so. However, others may be limited by a HP% or similar
 restrictions, like Makyosei-jin's Improved Growth Form
 requiring the Makyosei-jin to transform into their Growth
 Form before going into their Improved Growth Form.
 A superform modifies a character's -base- statistics, which
 are the statistics they have before counting any items such as
 trinkets or any other superforms. Superforms do not stack
 with each other or with Statboosters. You recalculate your
 character's derived traits (HP, Ki, End, APR, etc) based on the
 bonuses achieved through the superform.
 Gained APR is added to the end of the current round. Your
 current HP, Ki, Natural Shields, Natural Armor, and END
 raise by the same amount as your maximum, but only rise the
 first time you activate a particular superform or statbooster.
 When your derived traits are lowered through a superform or
 if you leave a superform, the opposite happens. Your current
 HP, Ki, End, Natural Shields, and Natural Armor's current
 and maximum values are lowered. APR is taken from the end
 of the Round, if any APR is left.

Low Races
 Chou-jin
 Their bodies never seem to age. They are quite strong with
 their Ki and have a talent for flying, but are physically one of
 the weakest races. Chou-jin are born in Heaven, created from
 a sinless soul and granted eternal life in a playful form.
 Though, most tend to grow into a mature being far wiser than
 their appearance gives them credit. Their life in Heaven is
 always short as they are simply given bodies, allowed a few
 days to adjust to them, then sent into the Neoverse. Like
 babies few ever remember their first few days. Furthermore,
 they may have been born in Heaven, but not all stay to a
 straight path.
 Despite their inability to breed (due to their young age),
 these beings do have different genders. Being that the Chou
jin are not raised by any parental figures, they have no
 common cultural ties. One of the few ties these children
 share is that most look like large dolls, which makes sense as
 they were bodies with a soul grafted on them. On the other
 hand, many end up being taken care of by an adult, who
 worries about a child wandering around alone. In particular,
 Triclops are noted for having a special liking of these ageless
 children.
 Average Height: 3'3" (99 cm) Average Weight: 40 pounds
 (18 kg) Life Span: Ageless. Interesting Traits: Though unable
 to breed, Chou-jin have different sexes. Most look like
 Russian dolls.
 Example: Chiaotzu.
 Statistics
 (27 additional points, max of 9 in 1 stat)
 Boosted Flight gives a +3 to all Strike/Dodge rolls.
 (Ment) Chou-jin are physically weak, but make up for it
 with mental prowess. All of a Chou-jin's Ki attacks gain +10
 Damage per 100 Max Ki that they have available (Charging
 does not increase this damage). Whenever an attack is
 enhanced with this bonus, you must pay your Level15 extra
 Ki, which does not effect Enlarged Ki Blast. This is calculated
 as ((Max Ki 10)/100). Notes

 If you want to use this to increase your Ki damage during
 a round, it must be declared in your pre-round initiative as
 PKU.
 If you do not use your attack at maximum power, you only
 gain (Max Ki *6)/100 damage, but do not have to pay the
 Ki cost of this ability.
 (Ment) Chou-jins start with a regular school of their choice
 at Level 1 and gain another school for free at Level 5, 10, 15,
 and 20. If they do not have the INT to learn another school,
 this takes them temporarily above their limit, but may delay
 learning future schools. Schools gained in this way grant
 double the normal stat bonus.
 Racial Powers (Ment) Improved ESP - The Chou-jin must
 have the Minor ESP power before taking this power.
 With this, the Chou-jin can communicate for no Ki cost
 across any distance with anyone he has ever come in contact
 with, as if he or she has sensed the target. Improved ESP is
 two-way: If you ESP someone they can respond to you even if
 they do not have this power or sense you.
 (Ment) Mental Barrier - This power is automatically
 obtained at Level 5.
 The Chou-jin are able to tap in to their Ki and manipulate it
 to grant a constant form of protection. This gives you
 additional resistance, based on your MNT stat. Mechanically,
 it means you gain MNT/4 resistance. This stacks with other
 forms of resistance as normal including the Level Z
 'Resistance' power.

 Low Races receive a free Fighting Style at Level 1 on top of
 their racial school. This also counts towards their INT limit.
 Pick six powers at Level 1. You gain two powers per level up,
 which may not be picked from the same tree.
 Racial Features (Phys) Due to their small size, Chou-jin
 always have +4 to Dodge rolls against opponents.
 (Phys) Chou-jin start with the Basic Flight power and do
 not have to pay Ki to use it. Other flight powers still cost Ki as
 normal. Chou-jin gain a bonus to all Strike and Dodge rolls
 according to the form of Flight they're using:

Ligon
 Ligons are a small, green-skinned people with four eyes. They
 are renowned for both their ability to manipulate time and
 their unrelenting refusal to provide any details about their
 home world, Ligon. This paranoia is so widespread that it
 often follows Ligons to other planets they live on, such is the
 case of Liquius where even the humans and reptiles on the
 planet feel the same paranoia about world visitors. Though
 one would be wise not to say this to them, Ligon are very
 much distant relatives to frogs. Though they are humanoid,
 they are amphibians, not mammals.
 When Ligons evolve from tadpoles, they are very similar to
 baby humans (save for the extra eyes and green skin!). There,
 they begin to learn to walk and adjust to living bipedal lives.
 Despite being amphibians, Ligons have a strict sense of
 honor and religious duty as well as mate for life.
 Furthermore, finding a Ligon that is not deeply devoted to the

 Ligons gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats every
 level up and an automatic +1 to all stats every level up.
 HP: 11 x STM+20xLevel
 Ki: 12 x MNT+20xLevel
 LP: 5 x STM
 HP Mod Increase at: 5, 10, 15, etc.

 Low Races receive a free Fighting Style at Level 1 on top of
 their racial school. This also counts towards their INT limit.
 Pick six powers at Level 1. You gain two powers per level up,
 which may not be picked from the same tree.
 Racial Features (Ment) Ligons have an unusual mastery of
 Ki, gaining +1 to Ki Damage (not Telekinetics) per 25 Max Ki
 they have available (Charging does not affect this).
 (Phys) The Ligon's secondary pair of eyes gives them an
 advantage in combat; providing them with a +2 to all Strike
 and Dodge rolls and immunity to the Zanzoken power. If a
 Ligon is blinded by Taiyoken power (or something similarly
 blinding), the Ligon loses these bonuses for the rest of the
 round.
 (Ment) Ligons are immune to their own type of Mind
 Freeze.
 (Phys) Due to their small size, Ligon always have +4 to
 Dodge rolls against opponents.
 (Ment) Ligons start with a regular school of their choice at
 Level 1 and gain another school for free at Level 5, 10, 15, and
 20. If they do not have the INT to learn another school, this
 takes them temporarily above their limit, but may delay
 learning future schools. Schools gained in this way grant
 double the normal stat bonus.
 Racial Powers Both of these powers are considered
 Telekinetic powers and as such Super Speeds cannot be used
 with or against these powers.
 (Ment) Time Freeze - The Ligon must be Level 2 before
 taking this power.
 Three times per round, a Ligon can hold their breath to
 slow down time, during which only they can move. In combat,
 everyone else is frozen in stasis and unable to even perceive
 the world around them. It's simply a blank until the Ligon
 allows time to resume. The Ligon may use this power after a
 failed Dodge or Parry to give themselves enough time to
 Block, Power Block, or Advanced Block instead. This costs 3
 End per use.
 Alternatively, a Ligon may spend two uses of this power to
 hold their breath for a longer period of time. This allows a
 Ligon to take up to their Level*2 Actions as a single action, as
 long as none of those extra actions have any direct impact on
 an opponent or any attended objects. This means that all
 attacks are out, but things like Charging (even charging into
 an attack!) is okay. The Ligon can charge, use items that does
 not affect another person, pick up unattended items, or
 similar actions. The Ligon must spend 3 END per extra
 action taken, in addition to that action's normal costs. Since
 time does not actually pass, the Ligon does not regenerate
 during these "extra" actions. They, also, do not count towards
 the duration of power and effects.

(Ment) Mind Freeze - The Ligon must have the Time Freeze
 power and be Level 4 before taking this power.
 Usable once per round, a Ligon may focus his time warping
 abilities on an opponent's mind and body, rendering them
 unable to move at all--even to defend themselves! This is
 resolved as a Telekinetic attack against all opponents that
 costs 10% of the Ligon's current Ki (including their Charging
 Ki Pool and Megacharge Ki Pool!) and 3 End and has a -6
 Strike Penalty, and the Ligon must roll separately against
 each target. Temporary bonuses to strike must be paid for
 separately for each strike roll. If it hits, the target becomes
 "Time Locked." While Time Locked the victim can do nothing
 but roll (40+(Their MNT or STR)/5 - (The Ligon's MNT)/5 
1d100). On a 0 or higher, they break free of the psychokinetic
 hold and may act normally on their next action. On a -1 or
 lower, the Ligon may pay 10% of their current Ki and 3 END
 to keep them Time Locked until their next action, up to a
 maximum of 2+Level/4 consecutive actions.
 While someone who is Time Locked is unable to defend
 themselves any attacks aimed at them become Locked as
 well. The attack is held in suspended animation mere inches
 from the target. When the Time Lock ends (either because its
 duration elapses, the Ligon chooses not to pay or because the
 victim broke free) the attack is resolved, and the target gets
 no defense or reflexive actions except the use of Auras and
 Shields. Thankfully, the attack takes a while to be fully
 integrated into the subject's timeline properly, so it only deals
 20% of its damage (after factoring in all other reductions) for
 each of the Victim's actions that have passed since the attack
 was Locked. Attacks that don't deal damage are negated
 against someone who is Time Locked, and the level of all
 incoming Critical Hits are reduced by one category (TAC
 becomes DAC, DAC becomes AC, AC is negated). If the Ligon
 using this power is killed or rendered unconscious while they
 have a victim Time Locked, then not only does the Lock end
 but all attacks against the victim automatically fail.

Martial Artist
 Martial Artists are the elite of their kind, who have taken the
 martial arts to incredible levels. Whereas, most races have a
 basic understanding of Ki from birth, humans have to work to
 grasp even the smallest understanding of it. However, those
 that do are known to be just as strong as the strongest
 warriors from races born with the most intricate knowledge
 of the arts. As such, these humans are renowned for their
 mastery of Ki and special martial arts schools. Many are
 sought out to be learned from.
 Furthermore, humans are the most populous race in the
 universe. Having been one of the first races to develop
 intergalactic travel, their numbers spread across the universe.
 It is rare to find a world not inhabited by humans. Even
 stranger is the fact that some planets, such as Bayushi, were
 already populated by humans for generations before anyone
 from Earth stepped foot on it. Perhaps, there is something
 special about what caused the evolution of humans, which
 causes it to reproduce itself so often elsewhere?
 Average Height: 5'10" (177 cm) Average Weight: 180
 pounds (81 kg) Life Span: 60-80 years. Interesting Traits:
 Especially resilient.

 Martial Artists gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats
 every level up and an automatic +1 to all stats every level up.
 HP: 10 x STM+15xLevel
 Ki: 13 x MNT+25xLevel
 LP: 5 x STM
 HP Mod Increase at: 4, 8, 12, etc.
 Ki Mod Increase at: 6, 12, 18, etc.
 Low Races receive a free Fighting Style at Level 1 on top of
 their racial school. This also counts towards their INT limit.
 Pick six powers at Level 1. You gain two powers per level up,
 which may not be picked from the same tree.
 Racial Features (Ment) Martial Artists regenerate Level*5
 Ki on each of their actions.
 (Ment) If a Martial Artist fires a Discharge (or any improved
 version of it) for half or less of the Ki he normally could have
 paid, he does not have to pay any Ki at all.
 (Phys) Martial Artist Aura This is a special ability that can
 be used to pay for the HP damage of any attack with Ki or
 used to pay HP for the Martial Artist's Ki costs.
 Used as a defensive aura, Martial Artists can spend 1 Ki to
 block out 1 damage of any attack. Shield piercing is able to be
 blocked with this aura, but Unpreventable attacks are not.
 There is no limit to the amount of Ki that can be spent. This
 aura is considered reflexive. This Aura can be used multiple
 times against Combo attacks, unlike other auras/shields.
 This aura can also be used to allow the Martial Artist to
 pay for Ki costs of powers using their HP. However, HP can
 not be used to fuel the MA aura. This also does not mean
 Martial Artists can swap HP into their Ki whenever they
 wish. The cost of this ability can never be reduced by more
 than 50% with suppression. Even at 90% suppression, the Ki
 cost will only be reduced by 50%.
 (Ment) Martial Artists start with a school of their choice at
 Level 1 and gain another school for free at Level 5, 10, 15, and
 20. If they do not have the INT to learn another school, this
 takes them temporarily above their limit, but may delay
 learning future schools. Schools gained in this way grant
 double the normal stat bonus. Martial Artists can not know
 more than one school for every 8 points of INT.
 (Ment) Truly experienced Martial Artists are great at
 mixing everything they have learned into a big pot of
 techniques that can be molded into their own, growing
 school. At Level 7, a Martial Artist can submit a Player
 Created School to the GMs, as if he'd possessed it from Level
 1. As many knows however, simply having the School doesn't
 make people want it. As the Martial Artist improves, so does
 its fame. At Level 12, the Martial Artist can then teach his
 school to up to two other player characters. The training
 takes 2 Neo Weeks. During this time, neither player is
 allowed to fight or EXP train.
 Racial Powers (Ment) Trained - This power is automatically
 obtained at Level 1.
 A Martial Artist can automatically choose one of the
 powers granted to them by their first level school. That power
 is considered to be three levels higher than it actually is for
 that power's purposes. Martial Artists may only choose from
 a power on the school list for this Trained ability. If a power is
 gained of a higher level than the school gives because the MA
 already had it, they can't choose that power. The School's
 Invent can be chosen for Trained. Some powers, such as
 Block, do not factor level in their use and picking Trained
 with them has no additional effect.
 (Ment) Supreme Shield - The Martial Artist must be Level
 5 before taking this power.
 The Martial Artist can use his Aura to block one
 Unpreventable attack per round, at the cost of 1 Ki per 1
 damage. There is no limit to the amount of Ki that can be
 spent. This ability counts as a reflexive shield, like his normal
 Aura, but the power Suppress Ki does not affect this shield.

Triclops
 Evolution is an odd thing, changing one race ever so slightly.
 After years and years of being the top of the food chain on
 Earth, Humans took a turn in the evolutionary circle. Unlike
 their advanced human counterparts (Martial Artists), they do
 not have a great grasp on harnessing their Ki. Instead, they
 are more physically powerful. Not only are they stronger in
 the ways of hand to hand combat, they are rather adept at
 separating techniques, able to split into as many as four
 separate beings. Above all, they have evolved a beneficial
 third eye, allowing them to see better than most other races.
 Unfortunately, though, they seem to have lost the ability to
 grow hair, as their bodies are very efficient at processing
 'waste'.
 Average Height: 6'3" (190 cm) Average Weight: 250 pounds
 (113 kg) Life Span: 120-150 years. Interesting Traits: Three
 eyes, bald.
 Example: Tien (Tienshinhan).

 level up and an automatic +1 to all stats every level up.
 HP: 11 x STM+25xLevel
 Ki: 12 x MNT+15xLevel
 LP: 5 x STM
 HP Mod Increase at: 4, 8, 12, etc.
 Ki Mod Increase at: 5, 10, 15, etc.
 Low Races receive a free Fighting Style at Level 1 on top of
 their racial school. This also counts towards their INT limit.
 Pick six powers at Level 1. You gain two powers per level up,
 which may not be picked from the same tree.
 Racial Features (Phys) The third eye of a Triclops gives
 them an advantage in combat, granting +1 to all Strike/Dodge
 rolls and immunity to the Zanzoken power. If a Triclops is
 blinded by Taiyoken or a similar power, the Triclops loses
 these bonuses for the rest of the round.
 (Ment) Triclops have an unusual mastery of Ki, gaining +1
 to Hand to Hand and Sword Damage per 25 Max Ki they
 have available (Charging does not affect this).
 (Phys) Triclops are capable of pushing their body to the
 absolute brink of exhaustion and beyond. Normally, they have
 STM*1.5 Endurance. Reaching 0 or less END on their own
 turn does not cause a Triclops to pass out. Instead, at the end
 of their turn; they are brought up to 1 END remaining. Split
Form/Trifork/Quadform de-activates. They, then, take 20% of
 their maximum HP in unreducable damage. If they drop to 0
 or less END outside of their own turn (for instance, from
 being Choked), they pass out normally.
 (Phys) Triclops are known for rapidly recovering from
 almost any injury. They regenerate Level2 HP, or Level1 LP,
 per action. They, also, heal from serious injuries at the
 following rate, or half of this rate if they also have the
 Immortal Unique:
 AC Broken Bone: 3 RL Hours.
 DAC Broken Bone: 12 RL Hours.
 TAC Broken Bone or Removed Limb: 24 RL Hours.
 (Ment) At Level 12, a Triclops is able to pass on the
 knowledge of their signature move to other people. Although,
 the result is less stable than for a Triclops. You may teach up
 to two students Split-Form or a single student Split-Form and
 Trifork. The training takes 2 Neo Weeks to learn. During this
 time, neither player is allowed to fight. When a non-Triclops
 uses Split-Form or Trifork, the following additional rules
 apply:
 All references to 50% become 25%.
 You may not inflict critical effects. The attack still
 becomes AP/SP and stuns for one action from the pain,
 which may have Ignore Pain applied against it.
 (Ment) Triclops start with a school of their choice at Level 1
 and gain another school for free at Level 5, 10, 15, and 20. If
 they do not have the INT to learn another school, this takes
 them temporarily above their limit, but may delay learning
 future schools. Schools gained in this way grant double the
 normal stat bonus. Triclops can not know more than one
 school for every 9 points of INT.
 Racial Powers (Phys) Split-Form - This power is
 automatically obtained at Level 1.
 This power may be used to split into two forms by
 spending an action or as a pre-round action. This allows you
 to act as two separate individuals per APR in order to
 complete more advanced tactics. But, dividing your power
 between multiple bodies is taxing in, both, focus and energy.
 This lowers your APR by 1 and costs 3 End per APR used in
 this way. Due to the strains of this technique, Superforms
 (such as statboosters) or other non-permanent superforms
 (except for mini-superforms granted by uniques such as
 Trance) are suppressed until you end this technique with an
 action or declared pre-round that you are no longer using this
 technique. Although they are two (or more in the case of
 Trifork / Quadform) entities, your Splits work off of the same
 pool of HP, Ki, and End as well as any form of Regeneration
 only being applied once to the entire pool.
 For greater clarity to any questions regarding Split-Form
 and more in-depth workings:
 When using an action in the fight to create or dismiss this
 technique, ALL actions of that single APR is consumed.
 This means you cannot split, take additional actions, and
 reform to reacquire extra actions.
 Buffs such as Ki Enhance or Increase Power Level apply
 to all Splits and can be felt separately, which may also
 reveal which Split is weaker than its others. This does not
 apply to Mantis Strike.
 Splits share all Uses Per Round, with the exception to
 non-Super Speed Type 2 powers with one use per action.
 Each Split may benefit from Bulk & PKU, but must pay for
 it separately per attack.
Items are replicated between splits, but if the item is
 consumable or can be damaged, then its use applies to all
 Splits.
 The exception to the above is Custom
 Weapons/Equipment, which can not be duplicated as
 normal. These items are unique.
 Splits must remain within 100 yards of each other. If one
 is in combat, they are all in combat.
 Uniques and Powers that function off of a pool of some
 sort, such as Ki Shield, Tactician, or Final Ki Attacker;
 share a single pool amongst all Splits.
 If multiple Splits attack on the same APR, then all attacks
 are declared and resolved at the same time. Apply the
 effects of all attacks at the end of the action, and also at
 the same time. Attacks against the same target otherwise
 function like a Multi Slash. Make a separate Strike and
 Damage roll for each attack. Super Speeds used to assist
 and oppose the attacks apply equally to all of the Triclop's
 attacks for that APR as normal.
 Super Speeds, the Focus Unique, Shadowform, and other
 things with an X/Round, X/2 Rounds or X/Battle limitation
 only apply to one Split. The others, instead, automatically
 benefit from Advanced Combat Teleport for free for that
 APR.
 After Reforming, all Critical Effects and other Status
 Effects are applied to the reformed whole. Status Effects
 or Critical Effects do not stack. i.e. If both splits have a
 broken arm, the reformed Triclops only has one broken
 arm, not two.
 When activating Split-Form, all Splits retain any status
 effects already afflicting the Triclops.
 You may not activate Split-Form while Grappling or being
 Grappled, including Racial Powers that function like a
 Grapple. However, you may maintain Split-Form after
 being Grappled or later begin a Grapple while in Split
Form.
 You select which Split remains as the "real" one when
 reforming (through damage or choice). This may get you
 out of certain location-based status effects such as
 grapples and capture balls.
 When initiating a grapple, any number of Splits may
 grapple the same person if you are successful (and the
 Split has not used his/her action). When doing this, no one
 else besides the Triclops may also grapple them. When
 multiple Splits are grappling one person, they count as
 only one individual with +15% STR per Split (+30% with
 two, +45% with three, +60% with four) in the grapple for
 grapple-only powers, break checks, and shift checks. Only
 one Split-Form may perform an action while this is being
 maintained, as all the other Split-Forms are busy helping.
 If you make use of a move that breaks the grapple, it ends
 immediately for all Splits involved.
 When firing a Ki attack at a Triclops involved in a grapple
 as above, you only deal damage normally to one Triclops,
 not all splits.
 Any single attack that deals more than 50% of a Split's
 Current HP causes him to immediately Reform to a single
 Triclops, even Mid-Combo.
 When Reforming, the Triclops has a minimum of 1 HP.
 Although this counts as a Superform, it costs no
 Experience to use in a fight, regardless of the current
 round.
 (Ment) Shin-Ki-Ko-HoBlast - The Triclops must be Level 2
 before taking this power.
 This is a technique primarily meant to hold opponents
 back. The Triclops forms a triangle with his hands and
 releases a ray of energy that stuns anything it damages. This
 is a Ki attack with a +5 bonus to Strike, which can be used an
 unlimited number of times per round, but only once per APR.
 It deals 1d610 damage plus 1d610 per additional level and
 is Armor Piercing and Shield Piercing. If someone is
 damaged by the Blast, he loses his next action. This stun
 effect does not stack as normal. Advanced Block negates this
 stunning effect. This attack costs 15 Ki per level and 7 END.
 (Phys) Trifork - The Triclops must be Level 3 before taking
 this power.
 This functions as an improved Split-Form and may be used
 in place of it. The differences are as follows, replacing similar
 rules mentioned under Split-Form:
 You create two additional Splits rather than one.
 This costs 5 End per APR rather than 3 End.
 This lowers your APR by 2, instead of 1.
 You may take 3 actions per APR, instead of 2.
 You may not inflict critical effects while Trifork is active. A
 critical roll will still stun the target for one action unless
 they have ignore pain. It also becomes AP/SP.
 Trifork is immediately and automatically
 downgraded to Split-Form when an attack damages
 the Triclops for 50% of his current HP. It, then,
 follows the rules of that power normally. Optionally,
 you may choose to end Split-Form and Reform
 instead.
 Trifork may not be activated while below 50% HP,
 but may be maintained at any HP.
 Although this counts as a Superform, it costs no
 Experience to use in a fight, regardless of the
 current round.

(Phys) Quad-Form - The Triclops must be Level 4 before
 taking this power.
 This functions as an improved Split-Form and may be used
 in place of it. The differences are as follows, replacing similar
 rules mentioned under Split-Form:
 You create three additional splits rather than one.
 This costs 8 End per APR rather than 3 End.
 This lowers your APR by 3, instead of 1.
 You may take 4 actions per APR, instead of 2.
 You may not inflict critical effects while Quad-Form is
 active. A critical roll will still stun the target for one action
 unless they have ignore pain. It also becomes AP/SP.
 Quad-Form is immediately and automatically downgraded
 to Trifork when an attack damages the Triclops for 25% of
 his current HP. It, then, follows the rules of that power
 normally. Optionally, you may choose to downgrade to
 Split-Form or end Trifork and Reform instead.
 Quadform may not be activated while below 75% HP, but
 may be maintained at any HP.
 Although this counts as a Superform, it costs no
 Experience to use in a fight, regardless of the current
 round.
 (Ment) Teamwork - This power is automatically obtained at
 Level 5. It always applies as a constant passive.
 Your Splits become significantly better at using group
 tactics to take opponents down together. You become
 immune to area of effect attacks from their own Splits such
 as the power Taiyoken. If multiple Splits attack the same
 person at the same time, their DEX and MNT are increased
 by 5% per Split for purposes of determining their stat
 modifier to strike rolls only (+10% with two, +15% with three,
 +20% with four).

Tsufuru-Jin (Tuffles)
 The Tsufuru-jin (also referred to as a Tuffle) are a frail, yet
 highly intelligent native of the Planet Plant. They protected
 their domain from the chaotic race of wilderness-dwelling
 Saiyans, but ultimately lost the battle and were forced off
 their own homeworld, now renamed Vegeta. Their civilization
 was heavily advanced and possessed technology that allows
 them to move spaceships beyond the speed of light, which is
 where they now live - in the cold depths of space. They
 appear to be naturally adept with using all forms of
 technology beyond the normal means of most races, which
 has given them an edge at survival that few would be able to
 achieve in such harsh conditions. They are not a particularly
 vengeful race. However, they might harbor ill-will or distrust
 towards Saiyans.
 Average Height: 5'9" (175 cm) Average Weight: 160 pounds
 (72 kg) Life Span: 250-300 years. Interesting Traits:
 Craftsman, technologically advanced.

 Pick six powers at Level 1. You gain two powers per level up,
 which may not be picked from the same tree.
 Racial Features (Ment) Tsufuru-jin may not be the the
 physically strongest or forceful of races. But, they are apt in
 finding the weaknesses of their supposed superiors. Tuffles
 may use INT/4 as their damage modifier for all attacks.
 When using their blaster, they must use INT/4 as their
 damage modifier.
 (Ment) Tsufuru-jin are capable of rapidly mastering new
 skills. Every time they level up, they gain 1 additional power,
 following the normal rules for gaining powers every level.
 (Ment) Tsufuru-jin rely on advanced weaponry to make up
 for their, otherwise, weak attacks. Tuffles carry around
 "Blasters" and other ranged weaponry capable of harming
 the other races. This blaster may fire metal ammunition. In
 which case, it functions as a racial sword that deals 4d10 AP
 damage per level, and becomes AS at Level 11. It, also, has a
 power cell with 6 Energy. By consuming one energy, you may
 fire a Ki Offense power through the Blaster. This does not
 cost Ki, but does cost 1 Energy. Multi-Fireball costs 2 Energy.
 Combos cost 2 Energy, +1 Energy per attack in the combo.
 When you use your Blaster to fire Ki attacks, you use DEX in
 place of MNT for your strike roll, and gain a +Level/2 bonus
 to Strike. You may not fire Invents, powers gained through
 the Ki Fighting Style, or any other attack that is not a "Ki
 Offense Power" through your blaster.
 (Ment) Tsufuru-jin are some of the most apt craftsmen in
 the universe. They may learn "Recipes" as though they were
 powers. Recipes allow them to craft items by spending a
 certain amount of credits and Neo Weeks spent crafting. You
 may only craft one item at a time. But, crafting does not
 interfere with training or fighting
 (Ment) Tsufuru-jin start with a regular school of their
 choice at Level 1 and gain another school for free at Level 5,
 10, 15 and 20. If they do not have the INT to learn another
 school, this takes them temporarily above their limit, but may
 delay learning future schools. Schools gained in this way
 grant double the normal stat bonus.
 Racial Powers (Phys) Reload! - This power is automatically
 obtained at Level 1.
 By spending an action, a Tuffle may recharge all of the 6
 Energy in his Blaster's Power Cell.
 (Ment) Advanced Shield Projectors - This power may be
 obtained at Level 1.
 Tuffles can deploy powerful personal shields to protect
 themselves. This shield costs no Ki and stops up to
 Level50+INT/2 damage, or Level25+INT/2 SP damage. At
 Level 5, this shield stops another INT/2 damage from SP and
 non-SP attacks. This shield may be used an unlimited
 number of times per round, but only once per combo.
 (Ment) Arms and Armor Crafting - This power may be
 obtained at Level 1.
 You may craft or repair Weapons or Armor of any type.
 This costs half of the normal amount of credits and takes 1
 Neo Week for a weapon or 1 Neo Week per Rank for armor.
 Repairing armor takes half of the time and credits of building
 a new one.

 You may craft Scouters, Dragon Ball Radars, Trinkets,
 Spacesuits, Spacesuit Repair Kits, and Weighted Clothing.
 This costs half of the normal amount of credits and takes 2
 Neo Weeks.
 (Ment) Rejuvenator Crafting - This power may be obtained
 at Level 1.
 You may craft Rejuvenators, special equipment that allows
 Dragon Ball Radars made by you have a +15% chance to
 find the Dragon Balls.
 (Ment) Operation - The Tsufuru-jin must be Level 5 before
 taking this power.
 Okay, look. When something is broken, you don't duct tape
 it up and hope it fixes itself... Maybe, you do. But, Tsufuru-jin
 for warriors to rapidly heal. This costs an amount of credits
 and time spent crafting it, as detailed below. While crafting a
 Rejuvenator, you may not craft anything else, but may fight
 and train normally. Rejuvenators increase the HP and Ki
 regeneration outside of combat, and heal criticals at an
 advanced rate. They heal anyone placed inside them, but may
 only heal one person at a time.
 Basic Model: Restores +10% HP and Ki per Neo Hour.
 Costs 1,000 Credits and 2 Neo Weeks.
 Advanced Model: Restores +20% HP and Ki per Neo
 Hour. Costs 3,000 Credits and 4 Neo Weeks. Level 1
 criticals are healed in 12 RL Hours.
 Deluxe Model: Restores +30% HP and Ki per Neo Hour.
 Costs 9,000 Credits and 6 Neo Weeks. Level 2 criticals
 are healed in 12 RL Hours, Level 1 criticals in 6 RL

 Miracle Model: Restores +40% HP and Ki per Neo Hour.
 Costs 27,000 Credits and 8 Neo Weeks. Level 3 criticals
 are healed in 12 RL Hours, Level 2 criticals in 6 RL
 Hours, and Level 1 criticals in 3 RL Hours.
 A Model may be "upgraded" by paying the difference in
 cost and time. For instance, going from Advanced to
 Miracle costs 24,000 Credits and 4 Neo Weeks.
 (Ment) Advanced Recipes - This power may be obtained at
 Level 1.
 This Recipe may be selected up to twice. Select two of the
 following benefits. These benefits do not stack with
 themselves. But, you can apply more than one modification to
 a single item.

 it. You may not place the same effect on a Trinket twice.
 This costs 1,500 Credits and 1 Neo Week of crafting.
 Tuffle Weighted Clothing crafted by you does not have a

 You may improve the striking point of a weapon,
 increasing its damage by +1d10 damage per level of the
 wielder. This costs 300 Credits and 1 Neo Week spent
 crafting.
 You may rebalance a weapon, making Slice cost -1 End to
 use up to a minimum of 1. This costs 300 Credits and 1
 Neo Week spent crafting.
 You may improve a weapon's basic design. Basic attacks
 and the Slice power deal +20% base damage. This costs
 300 Credits and 1 Neo Week spent crafting.
 know that replacement is always more effective (and fun)
 than letting it heal over time. A Tsufuru-jin may take up to one
 person under his "care" in a single Neo week--using surgery
 and robotics to repair critical hits. The results are usually
 significantly shinier and more obvious than the patient
 expected. But, few can argue with the results. The Tsufuru-jin
 can't spend that Neo week crafting (potentially delaying
 existing projects by 1 Neo Week), but is otherwise not
 occupied. The person taken under care must spend a certain
 amount of time recovering from the surgery. During which
 time, they may not fight. A Tsufuru-jin may work on
 themselves.
 AC Broken Bone: 3 RL Hours.
 DAC Broken Bone: 12 RL Hours.
 TAC Broken Bone or Removed Limb: 24 RL Hours. Note:
 Immortals and Triclops heal in half this time. An Immortal
 Triclops heals in a fourth of this time.

Yardrat
 The Yardrats are an alien race, who live a few light years
 away from planet Namek. While their planet seems to be
 without excess, their style of clothing emulates gluttony.
 Often, their outfits are lavish with ruffles and belts. Any
 variation of the style is acceptable based on social standing.
 However, deviation from the basic idea of the most popular
 fashion will often get a Yardrat discriminated against by his
 peers. Damaging a Yardrat's clothes may be perceived as a
 huge sign of disrespect.
 Physically, they never stand more than four feet tall, and
 never weigh more than seventy pounds. They, also, only come
 in one color: pink! Their bodies are small in comparison to
 their skull, which balloons above their large, round, yellow
 eyes like a globe, spotted with purple along the top center.
 These purple spots can differ in variation. But, by no means
 are they a reliable way of differentiating one Yardrat from
 another. They only have four fingers on either hand, and four
 toes on each foot. Yardrat do not have hair anywhere on their
 bodies. This includes a distinct lack of eyebrows. Androgyny
 is the name of the game if you are a Yardrat. It is speculated
 that they reproduce by growing their young in test tubes,
 created from an amalgamation of their DNA and other
 Yardrat DNA. They are born with the knowledge of each DNA
 donor. Thus, they are able to enter society almost
 immediately after being born.
 As a species, the Yardrat have proven to be nice to
 outsiders, welcoming the rare few who find their planet, and
 are curious of them. It is not in a Yardrat to deny the
 opportunity for gaining knowledge. They are, also, eager to
 share their knowledge and ability concerning the
 manipulation of time and space, if they see it to be helpful to
 someone outside of their own race. Their society is a perfect
 picture of unity. And, it is very rare for one Yardrat to turn
 down another who may need help.
 Height: 3-4' (Max) (91-121 cm) Weight: 60 - 70 pounds (27
31 kg) Life Span: 200-300 years. Age can be relatively
 determined by the amount of wrinkles on a Yardrat's face.
 Interesting Traits: When living in large groups, Yardrats are
 thought to follow a hive-mind mentality. Only a few Yardrats
 ever speak.
 Example: The Anime series did not single out a Yardrat.
 However, they are shown en masse, clustering around Goku's
 crashed space pod. They nurse him back to health, repair his
 ship, and teach him the Instant Transmission technique
 before sending him back home. He has no complaints about
 the species and seems rather fond of them in his recollection.

 Low Races receive a free Fighting Style at Level 1 on top of
 their racial school. This also counts towards their INT limit.
 Pick six powers at Level 1. You gain two powers per level up,
 which may not be picked from the same tree.
 Racial Features (Ment) Yardrats have a natural talent to
 slightly warp space and time, making them appear faster
 than they really are in reality. They gain a +2 to Initiative rolls
 and +1 APR.
 (Ment) Yardrats have a great mastery of their Ki, gaining +1
 to Ki Damage per 25 Max Ki they have available (Charging
 does not affect this).
 (Ment) Due to their overwhelming abilities with Ki, they
 are, also, proficient with the mind. They gain Level*5 damage
 to TK and Hybrid powers.
 (Phys) Due to their small size, Yardrats have a +4 to Dodge
 rolls against opponents.
 (Ment) Yardrats have a unique understanding of Ki and can
 use it defensively in ways other races can't. When a Yardrat
 uses the Aura of Protection power, it has a limit of 35 Ki per
 Level instead of the regular 25. Yardrats can also use up to 30
 Ki per Level with the Supreme Aura power.
 (Ment) Yardrats start with a school of their choice at Level
 1 and gain another school for free at Level 5, 10, 15, and 20. If
 they do not have the INT to learn another school, this takes
 them temporarily above their limit, but may delay learning
 future schools. Schools gained in this way grant double the
 normal stat bonus.
 Racial Powers (Ment) Temporal Distortion - The Yardrat
 must be Level 3 before taking this power.
 By freezing time, the Yardrat can automatically dodge an
 attack. This power functions like the 'Freeze' Telekinesis
 power, but may be used once every two rounds and costs only
 150 Ki and 3 End.
 Table of
 Contents
 91
(Ment) Shunkan Idou (Instant Transmission) - The Yardrat
 must have the Temporal Distortion power and be Level 6
 before taking this power.
 Shunkan Idou allows the Yardrat to teleport themself to
 any place that they can see, or a person whose Ki that they
 can sense. When used in battle, it gives a MNT/5 bonus to a
 Strike or Dodge roll, but can not be used with other Super
 Speeds. This power costs 150 Ki and 3 End to use and can
 only be used once every two rounds. Up to one other person
 may be brought with the Yardrat if they are physically
 touching (usually, this means they are in a grapple) by paying
 an additional 150 Ki and 3 End. This lets the Yardrat use
 Instant Transmission to dodge an attack from outside the
 grapple, even if they are being grappled; and allows them to
 help other people escape (see IT/Kai Kai Escaping, below).
 The other person need not be willing, but they do get a break
 attempt (even Flare Break) to escape the grapple, if they are
 unwilling.
 When the Yardrat reaches Level 12, they can teach this
 power to a single person, who must be at least Level 8.
 Teaching this power takes two Neo weeks. During which
 time, neither person may fight or train. The person taught
 this technique can not teach it to anyone.
 IT/Kai Kai Escaping Before battle has started, if someone
 attacks you, you can not teleport away to avoid combat
 altogether. When you wish to leave a scene, declare you're
 doing so and check that no one intends to stop you. If they do
 wish to stop or attack you, Initiative is rolled as normal. On
 the first action you get, you may attempt to teleport away,
 declaring as normal. Anyone, who wishes to attack you, may
 make any basic attack or basic discharge, with add-ons as
 normal, against a single Dodge with your bonus from IT/Kai
 Kai.
 If you dodge their attack, you successfully escape. If they
 hit you, you have failed to escape and take damage. Even if
 you reduce that damage to zero, you fail to teleport. It must
 be your action to teleport away. If you teleport and the person
 that you are fighting is also capable of teleporting with Kai
 Kai/IT, not by using a Super Speed, they may follow you, even
 if it's outside of their normal sense range.
 Failure to teleport away from combat still costs the power's
 normal amount of Ki and End.
 Note: If you use Freeze or Temporal Distortion, it only
 allows you to avoid a single attack, not all of them.

Medium Races
 Dodorian
 Dodorians are large, round, humanoid warriors that have a
 significant amount of dense fat covering their bodies along
 with the skeletal and muscular structure needed to support it.
 They have hairless, thick, pink or red skin. In places where
 hair would be on a human, Dodorians have sharp spikes
 growing from their skin instead. They are not known for their
 intelligence, but are not known for their stupidity either.
 Originally from the planet Blue Star, Dodorians are
 primarily seen serving the Icer race in a military role, such as
 shock troops or guards, for their entire lives past puberty.
 Though considered a slave race to the Icers, Dodorians enjoy
 a "favored" status and are treated more as servants than
 slaves during the lull between wars. This puts them in the
 unique place of being hated by those lower in the Blue Star's
 social structure, and alternately hated or liked by those
 higher. Most Dodorians develop a cynical, pessimistic
 personality from this dichotomy, some die from it.
 Average Height: 6'8" (203 cm) Average Weight: 455 pounds
 (206 kg) Life Span: 60-150 years. Interesting Traits:
 Dodorian skulls are three times denser than a human's skull,
 very technologically advanced race (second only to humans).
 Example: Dodoria.

(Phys) Dodorians have small spikes all over their bodies,
 making them dangerous in close-quarters combat. They use
 STR/4 for their STR mod instead of the regular STR/5.
 (Ment) Dodorians gain Max HP/800 to all of their Strikes.
 This does not affect Dodge or Parry! Temporary increases to
 maximum HP, such as through superforms or statboosters,
 does not affect this.
 (Phys) Dodorians have sharp spikes lining their bodies,
 granting HP/25 damage to all Hand-to-Hand and Sword
 attacks.
 (Phys) Dodorians are very hard to tire. Their endurance is
 equal to STM*2.
 (Phys) Dodorians are naturally very tough, gaining STM/4
 Resistance.
 (Phys) Dodorians have several layers of fat, which protect
 themselves. They have Natural Armor equal to 35% of their
 Max HP and functions as if they were wearing armor with no
 experience penalties. This armor (not their resistance!) stops
 Ignore Armor and Armor Shattering attacks as though they
 were only Armor Piercing. This armor recovers HP out of
 combat at the same rate as the Dodorian's health.-=( Racial Powers )=
(Ment) Rampage This power is automatically obtained at
 Level 1. Using the momentum of your weight, you can charge
 and smash into opponents, throwing incredible force against
 them as a result. Rampage can be added to any Hand-to
Hand attack, granting a +4 to Strike and adding the
 Dodorian's STM to damage. When used with a Combo
 attack, the additional damage applies to the last attack in the
 Combo, like Bulk. Rampage can be used twice per round and
 costs 3 End. The additional damage is added to the end of the
 attack and is not multiplied. Template: [(Damage+STR

 (Phys) Armor Improvement The Dodorian must be Level 3
 before taking this power. Their natural protection improves.
 Increase the Dodorian's Natural Armor to 50% of their Max

 the Armor Improvement power and be Level 6 before taking
 this power. Their natural toughness improves. Upgrade their
 Resistance Gain from STM/4 to STM/2.

Humanoid Dragon
 Like their name implies, Humanoid Dragons appear much
 like a human but with various dragon-like, or draconian,
 features. These can be minor, such as a human with wings
 and a tail. Or, they could look like a small dragon that just
 happens to walk on its hind claws. Dragons are divided into
 several breeds, which can alter their appearance or
 techniques even further. This makes them a varied and
 dangerous creature to encounter.
 Average Height: 5'6" - 12' (167-365 cm)
 Average Weight: 200-900 pounds (90-408 kg)
 Life Span: 200 years.

(Phys) Humanoid Dragons are tied to one of the
 fundamental forces of the Universe: Air, Celestial, Earth, Fire,
 Metal, Shadow, Water, or Wood. Select one of these forces at
 creation, like a Racial Class. See the accompanying "The
 Elements" node for further details.
 (Ment) Humanoid Dragons are capable of becoming more
 draconic and savage by infusing themselves with their chosen
 element. You begin with a Statbooster Personal Invent at
 Level 1. This statbooster begins with 20 Invent points rather
 than 30, and cannot have this amount increased by the
 Focused unique or other means that increase base Invent
 points, but it also does not cause an EXP penalty for its use in
 early rounds. While active, this statbooster grants a special
 passive benefit based on your chosen force.
 Table of
 Contents
 (Ment) Humanoid Dragons have wings, which lets them
 start with the Basic Flight power and do not have to pay Ki to
 use it. Other Flight powers still cost Ki as normal. Humanoid
 Dragons gain a bonus to all Strike and Dodge rolls according
 to the form of Flight they're using:
 Basic Flight gives a +1 to all Strike/Dodge rolls.
 Advanced Flight gives a +2 to all Strike/Dodge rolls.
 Boosted Flight gives a +3 to all Strike/Dodge rolls.
 (Ment) Humanoid Dragons can tap into their inner being
 with great ease and focus it into a single point, gaining +1 to
 all Damage types per 25 Max Ki they have available
 (Charging does not affect this).
 (Phys) Humanoid Dragons are hard to tire. Their
 endurance is equal to STM*1.5.-=( Racial Powers )=
(Phys) Spikes The Humanoid Dragon must be Level 3
 before taking this power. Spikes grow over the length of the
 spine, and any other desirable places as well (such as on the
 tip of wings or long, sharp spikes over the elbow). Due to
 these spines, a Humanoid Dragon gains +5 H2H Damage per
 Level.
 (Phys) Armored Scales This power is automatically
 obtained at Level 5. It stacks with other forms of resistance.
 The Humanoid Dragon gains natural Resistance, shrugging
 off minor blows with ease and ignoring portions of more
 severe attacks. Increase Resistance by an additional Level*3.
 (Phys) Dragon Strike This power may be obtained at Level
 1. This is an elementally charged strike or mouthblast that
 may be used once every two rounds. It can only be used while
 the Humanoid Dragon is using their Statbooster. It deals
 1d610 Damage per Level, becomes AP at Level 5, SP at Level
 9, and stuns someone damaged by the attack for one action at
 Level 12. This costs 25 Ki and 1 End per 1d610 Damage.
 This attack receives a special add-on based on the Elemental
 Force chosen. This attack may count as a Hand-to-Hand or Ki
 Attack, chosen when the attack is used.-=( Air )=
Air, can you catch it, can you hold it, can you even see it?
 Much like their namesake, the Air Dragonkin are here one
 minute, gone the next. Over hills, inside valleys, behind you
 whispering in your ear, or just off the horizon; they are a
 proud, nomadic people, who greatly value individuality and
 freedom. They are most comfortable in great, wide-open
 areas, which are conductive to their flying ability and their
 love of personal space. Unlike the other clans, they tend to
 spend their entire lives alone, perhaps in distant contact with
 friends and family. The only exception to their self-imposed
 wandering is when they find a mate, which they tend to stick
 around until the hatchling is born. Then, they are on their
 own. If you happen to see one gliding gracefully in the
 atmosphere, watch. For, you never know if you will ever again
 see such a beautiful creature across the skies. Passive: Super
 Speeds never cost any Ki or End, including Invents that work
 like Super Speeds.
 Add-On: On hit, the victim may not increase their current HP,
 Ki, or End through any means (even transforming or
 charging) for Level*1 actions
 94
-=( Celestial )=
The Celestial Dragons are not named for an inane ability to
 live in space vacuum. The nickname of Space Kin comes
 from a bastardization of their language, that of the very stars.
 They live in a culture that clings to philosophy, science, and
 astrology to form the basis of their own religion. The stars
 link all worlds together, through their light and from the
 forces of gravity. They believe life and death behave in a
 similar fashion. We are all linked. We are all one. Every action
 affects everyone else. The development of their society has
 led to many hours of meditation on the nature of existence.
 Upon their awakening to the higher forms of war in Chi
 usage, they found it came easily as breathing to their keen
 minds and bountiful spirits. They tend to cluster in small
 communities around a temple, living simple lives much like
 that of simple villagers. Passive: Gain +Level*5 to all Ki
 Damage.
 Add-On: Your attack affects up to your Level in opponents.
 Each target receives the full damage of the attack. You may
 use the Celestial Dragon Strike up to twice per round, instead
 of the normal limit.-=( Earth )=
The Earth Dragonkind are the most numerous of all dragon
 types. Perhaps, this is due to their hardiness. Perhaps, it is
 their knack for foraging and finding bountiful lands. They live
 in clans. Each family often has a dozen or more children,
 which live together for almost their entire lives. They are a
 primal creature, trusting their instincts that rarely lead them
 astray to survive in worlds that grow harsher by the
 generation. Should the apocalypse come, Earth Dragons and
 cockroaches will bear witness to the mass extinctions.
 Despite their large clans, they tend to be rarely seen, often
 living in the wilds in an almost caveman existence.
 Passive: You may not be stunned. Whenever you make a
 Strike or a Dodge roll, you may ignore one Critical Effect.
 Add-On: On hit, the victim loses the ability to use any Super
 Speeds above Level 2 (including Invents and Racial Powers
 that function like or say they are incompatible with Super
 Speeds) for 1+Level/4 actions. They are also stunned for 1
 additional action.-=( Fire )=
Bitterness is like a cancer. It eats away the host. But, passion
 is like fire. It burns all the rot away to leave only the ashes.
 The Fire Dragonkin are a passionate people. There are no
 half measures. Regardless of their moral standing, they act.
 Damn everything else. Their favorite areas to settle are
 dormant volcanoes, preferring the heat to all other climates.
 The abundance of metal and obsidian is pleasing to them.
 Both are vital to their art and warfare. Although hot
tempered, no one can accuse this proud race of being
 incompetent. They are trained from an early age in the arts of
 war. There are no families. There is the whole, the people. In
 the rare case of individuality, one justifies it by accomplishing
 their 'dreams' or ambitions.
 Passive: You deal an additional Level5 Damage to all Hand
to-Hand attacks.
 Add-On: When damaged, the victim's Ki burns off. They lose
 Level25 Ki and lose HP equal to half the amount of Ki they
 lost, which may not be reduced.-=( Metal )=
Injustice boils in men's hearts as does steel in its cauldron,
 ready to pour forth, white hot, in the fullness of time. Metals
 are a good way to describe these dragonfolk. They can be
 brittle as iron, pretty as copper, or the more rare but feared
 true steel. Rivals of the Fire Clans over territory, Metal is
 appropriate for their immensely tough hide and unyielding
 determination. They tend to be quite pragmatic, using logic
 and reason where others would rely on blind faith. They tend
 to be in tight-knit familial or friend-driven groups, established
 through hard-won trust. The hard-won respect and trust of a
 Metal Dragon can be truly priceless beyond measure.
 Passive: Gain Level*5 Resistance.
 Add-On: This attack is AS. If it deals damage to armor
 (including Natural Armor), that armor loses additional HP
 equal to its unreduced damage. Though if this 'bonus'
 damage destroys the armor, it won't carry over into HP.
 Anyone damaged by this attack loses all forms of Resistance
 for Level/2 actions.-=( Shadow )=
The very substance of ambition is as elusive as the Shadow
 and just as dangerous. The Dragonkin of the Shadow have
 embraced their nature like all others, always watching from
 the darkness. Over time, they have learned the secrets of
 others: where their power comes from and how to steal their
 advantages away through the use of cunning. A knife's edge
 poised at the heart of their enemies and conquered victims,
 the slippery shadowflight of dragonoids is one to be
 measured with caution. They tend to live among other races,
 manipulating them, occassionally taking them on as minions
 to serve them. Oddly enough, they tend to be protective of
 their subordinates, not seeing them as people but cherished
 prize possessions that they cling to hard, and brutally punish
 those that would damage something out of their collections.
 Passive: This statbooster does not cost any End. It can be
 activated pre-round.
 Add-On: When damaged, the target may not benefit from non
permanent superforms for 1+Level/6 actions. If they are in a
 non-permanent superform, they temporarily lose its benefits
 and penalties. They also may not activate any superforms for
 the duration.-=( Water )=
Rivers, ponds, lakes, streams; all contain water, but have
 different names. Yet just as all idealogy, they contain truths.
 The Water Dragonkin earned their name for their love of
 aquatic environments. They spend as much time swimming
 as flying. This did not begin from ideology or philosophy. But
 rather, their ancestors developed the habit as a way of cooling
 down after a long flight or battle. They are masters of change,
 able to adapt to almost any situation with very little
 complaint. They flow like their cherished liquids, able to
 disrupt another's stance and recovery just in time to prevent a
 disastrous assault from taking their life. Passive: Twice per
 round, on a failed Dodge or Parry; the Water Dragon may
 choose to Block, Power Block, or Advanced Block instead, at
 the cost of 3 End. Add-On: When damaged, the victim is
 rendered unable to use any form of Invent for Level/2 actions.

-=( Wood )=
There are always flowers for those that wish to see them. Too
 oft, the powerful crush them under their heels in their
 struggles for dominance. The Wood Dragonoids are a
 nomadic, spiritual people who cross the stars to heal scars.
 They lovingly craft garden worlds out of ruins, turning them
 into a veritable paradise. They have been rewarded for their
 centuries of deep connection to nature. They are linked to life
 itself. To oppose a Wood Dragonkin is to oppose nature and
 life itself. These dragonoids tend to have a warm, loving
 nature, tempered with caution. They are slow to act. But once
 stirred, they act surely. They are frequently besmirched for
 their lack of material possessions. But to a Wood Dragonkind
 who appreciates the beauty and mortality of life; they are
 already the richest of the souls on the mortal realm. For, they
 have the riches of nature's bounty within their very essence
 and under their guard.
 Passive: You regain 1 End and Level3 HP, or Level1 LP, per
 action.
 Add-On: On hit, the victim loses Level10 HP and 1 End on
 each of their actions for Level1 actions.

Jeice-Jin
 The Jeice-jin society closely resembles the society of Humans
 of Earth with a few key differences. At some point in their
 racial development, they were required to fight to keep their
 planet from being invaded. They quickly became experts in
 two things that they'd need to survive the wars: Ki and Speed.
 This development has helped them to survive to this day.
 However, having only recently been exposed to the galaxy
 outside their planet; the race is young, mentally, in the eyes of
 the Universe. Shocked to discover that they were not the
 supreme beings in their galaxy, they often use ego to hide
 from their imperfection and weakness. As a result, they are
 usually blindsided when encountering strength and progress
 in other fighters that they encounter.
 Ego became a mechanism of defense. Perhaps, a tool used
 by their people. To ease the mental transition between being
 supreme. To being one of many other average races. Initially,
 they were not a haughty people. Some of the Jeice-jin remain
 relaxed as they had been before the discovery of the Universe
 beyond their purple skies. While, others took things a
 different direction. Many of the Jeice fighters began reaching
 for power beyond the stars and left home in search of new
 strength and new terrain to explore. Despite the galactic
 immaturity, the Jeice-jin have quickly made a name for
 themselves with their ability to control and use Ki as well as
 speed. While they are not physically imposing, it is unwise to
 take your eyes off of a Jeice, if he or she is angered. However,
 because of the same galactic immaturity; Jeice are easily
 offended when they are misunderstood or taken by surprise.
 Human in appearance. Their skin color ranges the warm
 end of the color spectrum from red to gold. With hair often
 being white or a variation of white (warm white, cool white,
 off-white, pearl white, etc.), always white in some form. They
 come in a variety of builds, just like humans. Pinning just one
 body type on the race would be a dishonest representation of
 them.
 Average Height: 5' - 5'10" (152-177 cm)
 Average Weight: 80-160 pounds (36-72 kg)
 Life Span: 70 years.
 Interesting Traits: Most of the Jeice-jin Home Planet
 embodies a twisted beach environment. It's very tropical, only
 with red waters and purple skies that change based on
 weather condition. Also, no one knows the location except for
 the Jeice-jin. Though, an Icer found it many millenia ago and
 took a portion of their race to be used as slaves. Until
 relatively recent, these slave Jeice-jin were the only ones
 known in the Universe. The Icer plucked up an entire city,
 which became a ghost town for the Jeice-jin.

 Damage per 25 Max Ki they have available (Charging does
 not affect this). When charging into an attack, multiply this
 bonus by the number of actions spent charging into the
 attack.
 (Ment) Jeice-jin gain their Max Ki/750 as a bonus to all
 Dodge rolls. Temporary increases to maximum Ki, such as
 through superforms or statboosters, does not affect this.-=( Racial Powers )=
(Ment) Sonic Blast This power is automatically obtained at
 Level 1. Jeice-jin can unleash a high-pitched scream to
 damage their foes. It is a Ki attack that deals 2d6*10 damage
 per 25 Ki spent, with a max of 25 Ki per Level, but does not
 gain additional damage from PKU or anything else that gives
 additional damage based on Ki or HP. This damage is
 considered Unpreventable and Ignores Armor. This attack
 can only be used once every two rounds and can not be
 parried or countered. This may not be charged via the Jeice
jin's racial feature.
 (Phys) Flying Dodge The Jeice-jin must be Level 3 before
 taking this power. Flying Dodge allows the Jeice-jin to Dodge
 attacks, even while they're charging Ki into an attack.
 Although, they must be flying to do so.

Konackan
 Konackans are a race of virtuous warriors who dedicate
 wholly to any cause that the Kaioshins deem fit for them.
 Whatever they choose, they devote themselves to fully. They
 have pointed ears and spiky, brightly colored hair. The
 Konackans are a religious race that strongly adhere to beliefs
 in, and worshiping of, the Kaioshin. No particular Kaioshin
 are overly favored by the Konackans. There is an, almost,
 even split for which Paths are followed. Most are musically
 inclined. It is not uncommon to hear interweaving melodies
 as one walks through the streets in their cities. As a people,
 they are mostly peaceful and do not war with another. They
 are not overtly distrusting of strangers. However, they are
 protective of their planet. Non-Konackans visitors are
 punished harshly if they commit any serious crimes. Most are
 usually banished from the planet and firmly told to never
 return. But, death sentences are considered an appropriate
 punishment for severe transgressions.
 Average Height: 5'6" (167 cm)
 Average Weight: 130 pounds (58 kg)
 Life Span: 1,200-1,500 years.
 Interesting Traits: Each Konackan is given a musical
 instrument early in life. Especially pointy ears. No known
 Konackan has worshiped anything other than a Kaioshin.
 Example: Tapion.

 (Ment) All Konackan warriors have a single Spiritual
 Weapon. It is an especially well-crafted weapon with +2 to
 Strike rolls and deals 2d10 per the Konackan's Level. It is
 automatically Shield Piercing and becomes Armor Piercing
 at Level 8. It becomes Armor Shattering at Level 12. It can be
 Ki Enhanced at no cost. If the weapon is ever forcefully taken
 from them or picked up without permission, it deals its
 damage to the thief on each action. The weapon can only be
 released by giving it back to its original owner while sincerely
 speaking an apology for offending the Gods. If the blade of a
 dead Konackan is picked up, it may never be put down, short
 of cutting off the arm holding it. Konackans always know the
 direction of their Spiritual Weapon, even if it's lightyears
 away.
 (Ment) Konackans gain +1 to Sword and Hand-to-Hand
 Damage per 25 Max Ki they have available (Charging does
 not affect this).
 (Phys) Konackans can go for five days without sleep and
 suffer no adverse effects. Their endurance is equal to STM*2.
 (Ment) Konackans begin with two extra powers, which
 must be chosen from the Sword tree.
 (Ment) Konackans use their DEX/4 instead of DEX/5 as
 their modifier to all Sword Strikes.
 (Ment) All Sword Invents created by a Konackan begin with
 40 base Invent points, instead of 30.
 (Ment) Every Konackan has a unique Sword attack. It is
 considered a Weapon Attack Invent and follows its rules. It
 begins with 20 Invent points, which is not changed by the
 Konackan's racial feature. It is a special attack that is usable
 once every two rounds and follows the normal rules for
 personal Invents. This attack does not benefit from increased
 invent points from Uniques. Template: (15Level+2.5Level*
 (Level+1)) Invent Points-=( Racial Powers )=
(Ment) Dragon Fist The Konackan must be Level 5 before
 taking this power. Konacks can channel the power of a
 Celestial Dragon through their attack. This power modifies a
 Basic Sword attack or the 'Uppercut' Basic Attack. A great
 golden dragon is summoned as part of the attack and crashes
 into the opponent. The affected attack gains AS, UP, AC, and
 deals +1d810 damage per Level. This costs 25 Ki and 1 End
 per +1d810 damage and may only be used once per two
 rounds.
 When a Konackan reaches Level 12, they may teach this
 attack to up to two other people. It takes 2 Neo weeks per
 student. During this time, neither person (student or mentor)
 may fight or train, but may gain focus/school passively. The
 student must be at least Level 8 to learn the technique and
 uses the attack at their own Level. The Student(s) taught this
 technique can not teach it to others. Their understanding is
 not as thorough as that of the Konackan.

Makyosei-jin
 Makyosei-jin, often simply referred to as Makyo, are a rare
 breed whose true origin is shrouded in mystery. While the
 majority would agree that they are in fact demons who have
 escaped from Hell, others believe they are, in fact, just
 another alien race that has obtained the title of demons
 through their ruthless ways. While coming in many forms,
 shapes, and sizes; the Makyo all have one thing in common:
 their sheer brutality. They radiate evil. Even those who walk a
 lighter path still manage to strike fear into their enemies,
 causing some to scatter and others to react a bit slower than
 usual. While the average Makyo will take a more hands-on
 approach when faced with a problem, there are a select few
 out there who would rather work from the shadows and
 manipulate those for the sheer pleasure of watching chaos
 spread. Though normally short in stature, those who
 encounter them speak tales of a terrifying ability to
 drastically alter their shape. Most have an unusual color of
 hair, skin or eyes, but could also have horns.
 Average Height: 5'5" (165 cm) (Base Form), 8'8" (264 cm)
 (IGF) Average Weight: 260 pounds (117 kg) (Base Form), 900
 pounds (408 kg) (IGF) Life Span: 200-250 years. Interesting
 Traits: Red Eyes. Able to make weapons from their body. In
 the Neoverse, there is a planet, known as the Makyo Star,
 said to be the home of the Makyo. When they are near it, their
 strength drastically increases. Though no one lives on it and
 few ever see it, rumors have it that the forces of Hell cause it
 to move.

 (Phys) Makyosei-jin may use weapons easier than others.
 As such, all basic attacks with weapons are free. Uniques that
 reduce this cost further have no effect, but may reduce sword
 powers normally, if stated.
 (Phys) Makyosei-jin may create a weapon (such as a sword,
 axe, or staff) from their bodies as a pre-round action, or as an
 action taken in the middle of the round. This creates any
 Basic Weapon and costs 1 Ki per 2 Credits that the weapon
 would normally cost.

 +15% to base STM
 +15% to base DEX
 +10% to base SPD This costs 15% of your maximum
 Base (no Superform) End.
 (Phys) Demonic Strength The Makyosei-jin must be Level
 7 before taking this power. Makyosei-jin may channel the
 their demonic heritage into raw power. This add-on modifies
 a Weapon or Hand-to-Hand attack. It costs 10 Ki per Level,
 which must be paid for at the Makyo's maximum Level. In
 return, you add +1d10 to the attack's base damage per Level
 to any Hand-to-Hand or Sword attacks made during that
 action. In the case of Ambidextrous, you must pay for the free
 attack separately. In addition, the attack gains AP and SP.
 This power may be used an unlimited number of times per
 round.
 (Phys) Improved Growth Form The Makyosei-jin must have
 the Growth Form power and be Level 10 before taking this
 power. The Makyosei-jin gains a second form, which takes an
 action while the Makyosei-jin is in Growth Form. Growth
 Form's bonuses are replaced with the following bonuses:
 +45% to base STR
 +30% to base STM
 +30% to base DEX
 +20% to base SPD This costs 15% of your maximum
 Base (no Superform) End.
 (Phys) Improved Forms This power is automatically
 obtained at Level 12. Growth Form no longer costs End to
 transform and can be used as a pre-round action. Improved
 Growth Form adds +1 to HP and Ki modifiers and still costs
 End as normal.

Namekian
 The Nameks, also commonly known as Namekians or
 Nameksei-jin, are a race from planet Namek. They are
 humanoid with insect/reptilian/slug-like characteristics,
 including green skin, pointed ears, pink patches on their
 limbs, and antennae. They are known throughout the
 Universe as a predominately peaceful race. But, Nameks are
 more aptly described as philosophical warriors, being broadly
 divided into two classes: fighters and healers. Years before
 obtaining intergalactic travel, the Nameks were invaded by
 forces at war. Many of their people died while peacefully
 protesting the invasion.
 Namekians do not have genders, reproducing asexually by
 spitting out an egg, which usually shortens their lifespan.
 Despite not having a gender, they possess relatively
 masculine physiques. Usually, the sons are not a genetic copy
 of the father. Rather, the father has some control over what
 type of child will be formed. This can even result in the
 offspring being mutated to such an extent so as to not even
 resemble others of their species. It is said that the race was
 initially created by a powerful wyrm dragon. As a result, this
 extremely spiritual race often worships the Eternal Dragons
 rather than the typical devotion to a Kaioshin. Though,
 respect towards all Gods is common.
 Average Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
 Average Weight: 200 pounds (90 kg)
 Life Span: 250-300 years.
 Interesting Traits: Asexual, purple blood, plant-like, only drink
 water, and eat trees grown only on their homeworld (for
 pleasure, not subsistence).

 Table of
 Contents
 (Phys) Nameks are capable of regeneration. They regain
 Level*3 HP on each of their actions, or an additional level/3
 LP if they are reduced to LP. By spending energy, they can
 utilize a more active form of regeneration to recover from
 grievous injuries, or focus healing on specific parts of their
 body to continue fighting. It takes an action and costs a
 certain percent of the Namek's maximum Ki, but negates any
 critical effect suffered on that limb as if it had never
 happened. Criticals that do not damage limbs may not be
 prevented in this way.
 Finger/Ear: 5%
 Hand/Foot: 10%
 Arm/Leg: 20%
 Torso: 50%
 Head: 50%
 This regenerative ability can even prevent Nameks from
 dying. If reduced to 0 LP, they will still regenerate as long as
 their head is undamaged. If they receive more than Level*75
 Damage beyond their LP from a Ki attack, consider their
 head to be damaged beyond their ability to regenerate. Hand
to-Hand, Sword attacks, or targeting a body part, other than
 the head, with a Ki attack will not kill the Namek. When in
 this Sub-LP, the Namek gives off no Power Level and is, for
 all intents and purposes, dead. Only other Nameks, or races
 with Sub-LP, are aware that Nameks are hard to kill.
 (Phys) A Namek can split into two separate beings. See the
 Special Abilities tab for the details on this ability.
 (Ment) A Namek can permanently fuse with another
 Namek to greatly improve their power. See the Special
 Abilities tab for the details on this ability.
 (Ment) Nameks can channel energy through their bodies
 into unarmed attacks to increase effectiveness, gaining +1 to
 Hand-to-Hand and Sword per 25 Max HP they have available.-=( Racial Powers )=
(Phys) Natural Resistance This power is automatically
 obtained at Level 1. The Namek gains a natural resistance
 equal to STR/4, which stacks with all other forms of
 resistance.
 (Phys) Mystic Attack The Namek must be Level 2 before
 taking this power. The Namek may now stretch his fiber-like
 limbs beyond their normal capacity to enhance Hand-to-Hand
 attacks, except for Combos. The attack gains +3 to Strike,
 Armor Piercing, and Shield Piercing. It can be used once per
 round and costs 50 Ki and 3 End.
 (Phys) Enhanced Healing The Namek must be Level 3
 before taking this power. The Namek's regeneration
 increases to Level6 per action, or Level1 LP per action. If
 Born of the Dragon Family, their healing now cures 2d6*10
 HP per 25 Ki spent. They, also, may now heal LP in place of
 HP, at the same rate.
 100
(Phys) Namekian Bulked Form The Namek must have the
 Mystic Attack power and be Level 5 before taking this power.
 The Namek gains the ability to increase their physical size
 and prowess. By concentrating the Ki in their body, they can
 grow to the size of typical houses. This form reduces their
 available Ki and makes them slower but much more
 physically powerful. Transforming into this form takes an
 action. Once transformed, the Namek may change the Ki
 Reduction, but at the cost of an action.
 The Namek may reduce their Ki modifier up to a
 maximum of Level/3. For each point of Ki modifier
 reduced, the Namek gains +1 HP modifier, +5% DEX,
 +15% STR, +5% SPD, and -1 APR.
 The potential of this ability is reached at Level 12. At its
 limit, Namekian Bulked Form grants +4 HP Mod, -4 Ki
 Mod, +60% STR, +20% DEX, +20% SPD, and -4 APR.
 Upon transformation, the Namek may freely choose to
 reduce Ki modifier up to their current limit. The Ki
 modifier reduction can be changed afterwards, but at the
 cost of an action. This change may be done even while in a
 Capture Ball.
 Transforming into this form does not cost any End.-=( Racial Classes )=- You may pick one of the following
 classes. To choose Born of the Dragon Family, you must
 submit a BG and have it approved by the GM staff.
 1) Farmer Class Farmers can grow little trees with healing
 powers. Farmers can cultivate a small grove of 1+Level/5
 trees in any environment--even deep space. The trees survive
 not off of the environment or (as some scientists have
 posited) the farmer's vitality, but off of the loving bond shared
 between farmer and tree. Each tree produces enough food to
 feed one hundred people every day. In addition, the
 Namekian may harvest one special Fruit from each tree.
 Each tree only produces one Fruit at a time. It will not
 produce another until the previous fruit has been eaten or
 destroyed. The fruit will rot if it is away from its Namekian
 Farmer for more than a Neo Week. It takes a Neo Week for a
 new fruit to grow after the previous one has been consumed
 or destroyed. Consuming one fruit takes an action. It may
 also be done as a pre-round action. Eating a fruit restores
 10% Maximum HP, Ki, and End to the one who ate it.
 2) Tradesman Class Tradesmen take care of the craft work
 in town, performing the tasks for supporting the
 infrastructure needed to support the Farmers and Warriors.
 Nameks have little need for actual merchants when dealing
 with each other. But, when Nameks need a representative to
 outside merchants, Tradesmen serve as ambassadors.
 Because of this, some people mistake Tradesmen for the
 leaders of the Nameks. Tradesmen are capable of creating
 clothes and simple tools at will, through their own Ki. This
 takes an action, but has absolutely no combat application
 under any circumstances. Due to their wide range of
 experiences and frequent contact with the outside world, they
 are, generally, more robust and able to rapidly adapt to a
 combat environment. They gain +2 to HP and Ki Mod, +1 to
 all Strike and Dodge rolls, and gain 1 additional power per
 level up.
 3) Warrior Class Namekian warriors are the protectors of
 their people. Whenever there is danger to the society from
 within or from without, it is the Warrior Class that
 investigates and administers justice. These warriors are as
 strong as they come. They gain an additional Level3
 Resistance. And, their endurance is equal to STM1.5.-=( Restricted Class )=- To apply for this class, a character
 background must be submitted. There will be one BotDF
 Namek, maximum, at any given time.
 4) Born of the Dragon Family Considered the 'noble' class
 of Namekians, those Born of the Dragon Family are the ones
 who hold the spiritual center of the Namekian race and are
 rather few in number. These "Gurus" are responsible for the
 spiritual well being of their race. They gain +2 to Ki Mod and
 add +Ki/25 to all Ki Damage (Charging does not affect this).
 They, also, begin with the Sense Ki and Sense Path powers.
 Born of the Dragon Family Nameks may heal themselves
 or others with a touch. As an action, they may cure 2d410 HP
 for every 25 Ki spent, up to a limit of 25 Ki per Level. A single
 person may only benefit from this healing once per day.
 When someone is healed, critical effects may also be restored
 at the cost of a percent of the Namek's maximum Ki. This
 cost is the same as the cost for a Namekian healing his own
 critical effects through the regeneration feature. In addition
 to instant healing, someone under long term care of a Guru
 will heal much quicker. Out of combat, if a Guru is attending
 to you; heal +Level2 LP, or +(Level)% of maximum HP and
 Ki, per every Neo Hour. Critical Effects are healed as though
 you had the Immortal Unique, or half of that time if you
 actually have the Unique. This does not stack with any of the
 Rejuvenators but does stack with the Home modifier. A Guru
 may even invite you into their home to allow you to benefit
 from their home's healing abilities. A Guru may care for up to
 their Level in people at a time, but may not fight while caring
 for people.
 For the Born of the Dragon Family, the Namekian Bulked
 Form takes on unique properties. Their larger frames
 become a more appropriate vessel for their advanced wisdom
 than a source of physical might. They may activate this form
 as a pre-round action.
 For each point of Ki modifier reduced, the BotDF Namek
 gains +1 HP modifier, +5% DEX, +10% STR, +5% MNT,
 +5% SPD, and -1 APR.
 The potential of this ability is reached at Level 12. At its
 limit, Namekian Bulked Form grants +4 HP Mod, -4 Ki
 Mod, +40% STR, +20% DEX, +20% SPD, and -4 APR.
 Finally, those Born of the Dragon Family may create the
 Sacred Dragon Balls. Doing so requires access to the Wyrm
 Dragon. Talk to the Staff for details, should the opportunity
 present itself.

-=(Permanently Splitting or Fission)=
A Namekian may permanently split at any time outside of
 combat. Perma-Splits inside of combat cannot occur without
 GM approval. This is for everyone's convenience and ease of
 play and should always be avoided due to this fact.
 When this happens, the process creates two entirely new
 beings. The alignments of these two beings must be
 opposing. If one is Good, the other is Evil. If one is Neutral
 Good, the other is Neutral Evil. Neither Split may be True
 Neutral. Both Splits have 75% of the original Namek's
 Statistics. A player whose Namek has split up like this, now
 has two characters to play. They can only play one of them at
 a time. If one dies, the other dies as well. So, it is in their
 interest for both to stay alive. Likewise, if one is fused into a
 Any regular School Invents are also gained. The new
 Namek may no longer learn these schools.
 Player Schools are not gained in this way, nor are their
 Invents or Powers.
 The new Namek's Alignment may be altered by the
 Fusion, by their decision.
 The Fusion can be done without GM supervision, but must
 have been approved beforehand. The Player should also
 inform a GM about the Fusion as soon as possible, including
 the time and room of where the Fusion took place. The
 Player should also keep the other Player's logs and stats at
 different Namek, both cease to exist unless that Split is the
 Namek that remains after the Fusion.
 Normally, rejoining is something that neither wishes to do.
 Their opposing Split is a manifestation of all that they abhor
 and the other likely doesn't like him either. Only in unusual
 circumstances should a GM allow the Splits to fuse back
 together, since neither can force the other. If it does happen,
 upon reforming into a single being, only one of the original
 Paths or True Neutral (pending GM approval) may be chosen.
 Restrictions on morality are also removed upon reforming.
 After re-fusing, they may not separate ever again. Follow the
 Fusion rules below for more information. But, information
 included in this section is considered to overrule Fusion info,
 where applicable.
 Note: this can be done at creation by asking a GM for
 approval. If approved, both forms will still have the same
 Uniques and Stat Bonuses as applied before the Split, as if
 done during play. The exception to their identical nature is
 that they may each select a different school. When a Split is
 done in this way, they both take half of the stats from their
 school and apply it to their separate stats. They also do not
 share school invents, but share Personal Invents.-=(Fusion)=
This is used only in dire circumstances, such as when a
 Namekian is dying or death is imminent and another
 Namekian is available nearby. This can never be forced upon
 a Namek. And, Fusing must be approved by a GM.
 The Primary Namek will need to be chosen through Out-of
Character discussion. If this cannot be decided, roll dice. The
 Primary Namek adds 25% of the other Namek's stats to their
 own. Uniques do not transfer, if different. Any items
 belonging to the Secondary Namek now belong to the
 Primary Namek. The Primary Namek gains knowledge of
 items from the Secondary Namek, hidden items included.
 The Primary Namek gains numerous benefits from the
 Fusion.

 The Primary Namek gains the powers of the Secondary
 Namek. If the Primary already has them, he gains nothing
 (no gaining higher powers of the same tree, as when
 gaining a school).
 The Primary Namek also gains one of the Secondary
 Namek's Personal Invents, which is adjusted for the new
 Namek's Level. (Unless, the Fused Namek is from a
 Permanent Split. In which case, they do not gain any
 Personal Invents.)
 Powers with a Level Requirement are gained, but can not
 be used until the Level Requirements have been met.

Paiku-han
 Paiku-han are green-skinned humanoids with flat, square
 ears and large, light-colored lips. Paiku-han do not have hair
 or noses. Like humans, they love a challenge of any sort,
 either physical or mental. Originally from the planet Bayushi,
 life was rough on the underdeveloped planet. Failing to
 overcome a challenge usually meant death. They tend
 towards attempting to understand what already exists over
 attempting to create new things. As the former is safer on
 such a dangerous planet. This led to a relative lack of
 technological presence throughout the Neoverse, and
 explains why Paiku-han have a tendency to settle on remote,
 sparsely inhabited, or uncivilized planets. The attempts of
 Paiku-han to understand how the Universe works has led
 them to be a sort of intellectual-spiritual race, but not a
 religious one.
 The culture of the Bayushi-born reflects the values of most
 primitive tribal life. Though, they are by no means still
 primitive. Paiku-han are expected to provide for their
 family/group, protect the weak and less able, and respect the
 elders who are the leaders and teachers of the group.
 Strangers are usually treated with suspicion, but not overt
 hostility, until they have proven their worth or peaceful
 intentions. A Paiku, who has left their planet to seek fortune
 elsewhere, usually retains the same values. Greedy and
 selfish Paiku-han tend to die off from Bayushi's natural
 dangers. Though, multiple generations may eventually phase
 out those values.
 Average Height: 5'11" (180 cm)
 Average Weight: 190 pounds (86 kg)
 Life Span: 80-100 years.
 Interesting Traits: Paiku is the singular form of their race's
 name. Paiku-han is the plural. Paiku-han wear either turbans
 or tall, cylindrical hats with a turban-like wrap at the bottom.

 at Level 1. The Paiku can now use their voice to channel a
 devastating attack of Sonic Energy. It costs no Ki, but is
 otherwise considered a Ki attack which deals 1d410 damage,
 plus 1d410 damage per two levels of the Paiku. This attack is
 considered Unpreventable and Ignores Armor, in addition to
 stunning the opponent even if they use Advanced Block. This
 attack can not be parried or countered. A Paiku can safely use
 this power once per round, but can choose to use it multiple
 times per round. Each additional use per round has a 50%
 (50-1d100) chance of straining the Paiku's vocal cords,
 making him unable to use this attack, or speak at all, for a
 Neo week.
 (Ment) Improved ESP The Paiku-han must have the Minor
 ESP power before taking this power. The Paiku-han can now
 communicate across any distance with anyone that they have
 ever come in contact with, as if they sensed the target. This
 does not cost any Ki to use. Improved ESP is two-way. If you
 communicate through ESP to someone, they can respond to
 you, even if they do not have this power or sense you.
 (Ment) True Versatility The Paiku must have the Sonic
 Attack and Improved ESP powers before taking this power.
 The Paiku can now switch between fighting techniques more
 easily than others, making them more diverse in how they
 fight. They gain an additional use per round for one power of
 Level 3 or lower in each of the following power trees:
 Offensive Ki, Hand-to-Hand, and Sword. This power may not
 be used for basic attacks with limited uses per round.

Recoomian
 Recoomians are tough, physically powerful warriors. They
 look somewhat like enormous, muscular humans of truly
 Herculean proportions, the shortest Recoomian still dwarfs
 most humans, and the weakest still look like humans on a
 strict steroid regimen. Most Recoomians have tall heads (and
 foreheads), tuft-like hair of varying shades of red, and large
 eyes with small irises.
 Recoomians value physical strength above all else, even
 from other races. If one were to call a Recoomian stupid,
 nothing out of the ordinary would happen, if they were
 instead called weak, a fight would immediately break out.
 The leader of a group of Recoomians is always the strongest,
 and any change of leadership is always through a one-on-one
 fight between challenger and current leader. This fight can
 occur at any time, even in the middle of a war if the leader
 agrees to it (they usually do). Those displaced from
 leadership in this way usually leave their group in shame and,
 if previously independent from servitude, go to Blue Star to
 serve an Icer.
 Recoomians who serve Icers are not viewed negatively by
 their brethren, as Icers are inherently strong and
 Recoomians have a long history of being subservient to them.
 Recoomians do not hold intelligence or mental acuity in
 very high regard. They believe such things are unnecessary to
 those who are strong enough. Such traits are not despised by
 Recoomians, however, they only hate those who use them as
 an excuse for their physical weakness. Most Recoomians are
 just smart enough to use basic technology of other races with
 some guidance, but have never invented anything useful.
 Average Height: 7' (213 cm)
 Average Weight: 250 pounds (113 kg)
 Life Span: 50 years. Rare few, who do not die in combat or
 accidents, can live up to 110 years.
 Interesting Traits: Though slow and lumbering, Recoomians
 are graceful dancers.
 Example: Recoome (Rikuum).

 until level 3. It grants the Recoomian a natural resistance of
 his STR/4. With the Resistance Z power, this becomes
 STR*3/4.
 (Ment) Adrenaline Boost This power can not be taken until
 level 5. This power may only be activated when the Recoom
 falls below 75% of their maximum HP. The first time its
 activated in a battle it may be done in response to receiving
 damage and does not take an action. Afterwards, it takes an
 action to de-activate it, re-activate it or change whether it is in
 "Offense" or "Defense" mode. While active, the Recoom gains
 +2 APR and they may select Offense or Defense. If they select
 Offense, they deal +50% Damage. If they select Defense, then
 they reduce all incoming damage by -50% or -25% if you
 block. However, all END costs are doubled, except for the
 END cost of Statboosters and the power Increase Powerlevel.
 While active, the Recoomian may not use the powers Rest,
 Rejuvenate or the Invent Meditation. This counts as a
 Superform, but it stacks with Statboosters.

 (Ment) Recoom Boom! This power can not be taken until
 level 6 and requires the Adrenaline Boost power. This is a
 special Ki attack that is only usable in a grapple and only
 when the Recoomian is considered the attacker.
 When this power is used, the Recoomian screams
 "RECOOM BOOM", replacing 'RECOOM' with their own
 name. They fire a burst of Ki from their mouth at the same
 time the Recoomian squeezes their victim in a vicious bear
 hug. It deals 1d610 damage per two levels of the Recoomian,
 plus all their bonuses to Ki attacks, plus their STR/2. The
 damage is Unpreventable and the Recoomian does not take
 damage from this attack unlike normal ki attacks in a
 grapple. It costs 15 Ki per 1d610 and can be used once every
 other round.
 It can not gain bonuses from Powerful Ki User, any
 Bulking powers or anything that multiplies damage
 (Damaging aura, Berserker, Wild Ki, etc).

Reptilian
 Reptilian Warriors are divided into several breeds; each of
 which have a different color and associated ability they focus
 in. While they were originally created artificially many
 hundreds of years ago, they've since developed into full
fledged, if very small, races of their own. They have no real
 home world to call their own, so they tend to be sparse in
 population density compared with any other race in the
 galaxy.
 Average Height: 5'6" - 12' (167-365 cm)
 Average Weight: 200-900 pounds (90-408 kg)
 Life Span: 80 years.
 Interesting Traits: Tend to be reptilian in appearance with no

 on their Racial Class, provides you with access to their color
specific node found under the 'Colors' tab.-=( Racial Classes )=
One of the most defining things about a reptilian is their
 breed or clan of origin. This is usually rather obvious, as
 reptilians are quite literally color-coded. The various types of
 Reptilians are so diverse, that they are practically unique
 races. The breeds of Reptilian are as follows:
 Gold: The golden Reptilians were designed to be almost
 exclusively ki users and very powerful ones at that. Their
 golden color can vary anywhere from being true, brilliant
 gold, to a darker, bronze sort of color. Gold Reptilians start
 with +5 MNT.
 Black: These are slightly more common than the other
 species of Reptilians, perhaps because they have a very
 simple specialty: breaking things and breaking them well. Just
 how black they are varies from being the color of tar to only
 having dark skin. Black Reptilians start with +10 STR.
 Red: This caste of Reptilians is mainly true to their name in
 terms of color, though oranges and pinks are not unknown
 among them. They're unbelievably accurate. Red Reptilians
 start with +5 DEX.
 Green: Green Reptilians are noted for how difficult it is to
 subdue one by sheer force. While there are fewer exceptions
 to their color than with other breeds, they also have an
 extremely wide range of greens. Green Reptilians start with
 +10 STM.
 Blue: The final caste of Reptilians colors often range from
 actual blue to teals and even light bluish-greens such as aqua.
 Blue Reptilians start with +5 SPD.
 Black Reptile-=( Racial Features )=
(Phys) A Black Reptile's muscle-reinforced scales are
 resistant to damage, granting them STR/4 Damage
 Resistance.
 (Phys) Due to their sheer physical strength, Black
 Reptilians use Str/3 to determine their Str mod to damage
 and Str/4 for the Parry Blast power.
 (Phys) While in a Grapple, a Black Reptile's STR is
 considered 20% higher for purposes of grapple checks and
 grapple-only moves.
 (Phys) A Black Reptile's anaerobic prowess lets them move
 faster than their larger size would appear, granting +2 Strike
 and Dodge.-=( Racial Powers )=
(Phys) Evolved Strength This power cannot be taken until
 level 3 and may only be taken once. When it is, the reptilian
 gains a permanent +10% STR. This bonus stacks with
 Statboosters, but is applied first.
 (Phys) Alpha Bulk Up This power cannot be picked until
 level 5.
 Activating this power takes an action and it lasts for their
 Level in actions. It costs 2 END and 25 Ki per action it lasts
 and it may not be de-activated prematurely. While active, all
 of a Black reptile's attacks deal +(STR/5)% more damage:
 even Ki, Telekinetic and Grapple Moves are affected! A Black
 Reptile may not use Rest, Rejuvinate or Meditation while this
 is active and their attacks may not benefit from Bulk or PKU.
 Further, their racial bonus to resistance increases from
 STR/4 to STR/2.

 their Flight Multiplier.
 (Phys) Blue Reptiles are some of the fastest being in the
 universe. When determining how fast they are for purposes
 of pursuing or escaping someone, consider their total flight
 speed to be doubled. This doubled flight speed does not apply
 to strike, dodge, or damage.
 (Phys) Halve the Ki and END cost of all Superspeed and
 Flight powers for Blue Reptiles, including Shadowform but
 not including Blue Blur.

 to make themselves more lethal, adding MPH/50 to all
 damages.-=( Racial Powers )=
(Phys) Evolved Speed This power cannot be taken until
 level 3 and may only be taken once. When it is, the reptilian
 gains a permanent +10% SPD. This bonus stacks with
 Statboosters, but is applied first.
 (Phys) Blue Blur This power cannot be picked until level 5.
 Activating this power takes an action. It gives you +1
 strike/dodge per 500 MPH you are currently flying and lasts
 for your level in actions, costing 2 Endurance and 25 Ki per
 action it lasts. This bonus does not stack with superspeeds
 and does not apply for or against Telekinetic Attacks. You
 cannot use Rest, Rejuvenation or Meditation while Blue Blur
 is active and you cannot end it prematurely. This can be
 activated reflexively as a response to an attack, but in that
 case it costs 4 endurance for every action it lasts. Either way,
 it may not be de-activated prematurely.

 (Ment) Golden reptilians have a Natural Shield equal to
 15% of their maximum Ki. This shield is reflexive and may
 stop SP attacks by spending 2 Shield HP for every 1 damage
 prevent. Every time they charge to add to their Ki Pool, use
 flare, or charge into an attack, this shield regains their
 MNT/4 HP.

 level 3 and may only be taken once. When it is, the reptilian
 gains a permanent +10% MNT. This bonus stacks with

 (Ment) Golden Charge This power cannot be picked until
 level 5. This power may be activated as an action and lasts for
 the user's Level in actions. While active, the Golden Reptile
 may use one power from the Powering Up tree other than
 Megacharge on each of their actions without it consuming
 their action. This will allow them to charge twice on their
 actions or even charge and perform some other action. They
 can even use these free Charges to charge into an attack!
 This costs 2 END and 25 Ki per action, and may not be
 deactivated prematurely. A Golden Reptile may not use Rest,
 Rejuvinate, or Meditate while this power is active.

 Level6 HP on each of their actions. All of their attacks cost an
 additional 2 END, but add HP/10010 to their damage rolls.
 This extra damage is added at most once per turn and is
 treated like a bonus from Bulk or PKU. This costs 2 END and
 25 Ki per action, and may not be de-activated prematurely.
 They attacks may not benefit from Bulk or PKU, except
 Bulking Aura, while this power is active. A Green Reptile may
 not use Rest, Rejuvenate, or Meditate while this power is
 active.

(Ment) Red Reptilians automatically start with the Multi
 Punch and Multi-Kick powers. They may use both of those
 powers an additional time per round each.
 (Phys) Red Reptiles are able to work off of pure reflexes.
 All penalties to strike, even those innate to the power or
 action being performed, are halved.
 (Phys) Red Reptiles are apt at working their limbs around

Saiyan Half-breed
 Although there are many instances of interracial breeding,
 none are as frequently occurring as the human-saiyan
 pairing. Saiyans look down on these half-breeds and humans
 tend to fear them, making them outcasts no matter where
 they go. They share both a human's ingenuity and a saiyan's
 incredible lust for battle, as well as the ability to transform
 into gigantic fierce apes under the proper circumstances,
 making them interesting - and difficult - to fight. These
 Saiyans generally take on the normal Saiyan personality, with
 black spiky hair and a strong will for fighting. However, this is
 not always the case and some have been known to be born
 with oddities such as purple hair. Even stranger is the fact
 that these beings are capable of reaching the coveted status
 of Super Saiyan with ease, while their full blooded brethren
 must go through the most strenuous of ordeals.
 Average Height: 6' (182 cm)
 Average Weight: 210 pounds (95 kg)
 Life Span: 60-80 years.
 Interesting Traits: Monkey-like tails, quick and intuitive, free

(Phys) All Saiyans have a tail which is a source of great
 power and great weakness for them. Their tail is required for
 both Oozaru transformations (described in their Superforms
 node). However, when a Saiyan's tail is grabbed they become
 effectively paralyzed. The Saiyan can no longer take any
 actions, dodge, parry or counter and their Str is considered to
 now be 2 until their Tail is released. They are considered to
 be in grapple with their opponent during this.
 Grabbing a Saiyan's tail is treated as a normal grab
 attempt; specifying that you're targeting their tail. A Saiyan's
 Tail has 5% of the Saiyan's Max HP. It can be regrown in a
 rejuvenator, regardless of the Saiyan's age. Trying to strike a
 Saiyan's tail is at a -5 and you can not use Multiattacks or
 Combos (They are too inaccurate to properly aim). You can
 not target a Saiyan's tail in a Grapple, unless you went to
 Grab their tail when you began the Grapple. A Saiyan Half
Breed who loses their tail can have it regrown in a Neo Week.
 (Ment) Saiyan Half-Breeds regenerate level*3 Ki on each of
 their actions.
 (Phys) Although not actively bred for war, Half-Saiyans still
 inherit a portion of their ancestry. They gain HP/600 to all
 Strikes and Dodges. Temporary increases to maximum HP,
 such as through superforms or statboosters, does not affect
 this.
 (Ment) Saiyan-Martial Artist Aura: This special ability was
 the primary inherited feature from the Martial Artist parent
 of the Half-Saiyan. This allows them to create an extremely
 powerful aura from their energy. It is a reflexive shield, that
 costs (Damage Stopped)*4/3 Ki. There is no limit to the
 amount of ki that can be spent. This may only be used once
 per combo, but has no per-round limits. At level 3, the Half
Breed has learned how to defend against Shield Piercing
 damage. The cost of this ability can never be reduced by
 more than 50% with suppression. Even at 90% suppression
 the ki cost will only be reduced by 50%.
 (Ment) The mixture of the wisdom of humans and the
 physical prowess of Saiyans has granted Saiyan Half-Breeds
 a heightened affinity with learning to control chi. Their base
 invent points start at 40.
 (Ment) Saiyan Half-Breeds gain additional schools at levels
 1, 5, 10 and 15. If they do not have the INT to learn another
 school then this takes them temporarily above their limit, but
 may delay learning future schools.
 (Ment) Saiyan Half-Breeds have a 10% chance per level of
 controlling Oozaru (Max of 80%).-=( Racial Powers )=
(Ment) False Moon This power can not be taken until level
 3. This power allows the Saiyan Half-Breed to create a pale,
 shining orb in the air which mimics a moon. It allows a
 Saiyan Half-Breed to stare into its bright light and transform
 into their Oozaru form, even if the Planet they are on has no
 moon or if it's daytime. This costs 25% of your current END
 and Ki (including Charging Ki Pools). The transformation
 lasts until there are no opponents left (note that a rampaging
 Oozaru considers all non-Oozaru its enemy) or until the
 Saiyan's tail is cut off. Every Saiyan and Half-Saiyan in the
 combat who is capable of transforming into Oozaru does so,
 paying this power's cost even if they do not know it. This is a
 superform with the following traits: +50% STR +100% STM
 for purposes of calculating Hitpoints only.
 Can uproot a piece of the scenery (usually a tree) as a non
action to use as an improvised sword that has -2 Strike
 but deals 1d6*10 damage per level. Plot relevant scenery
 and scenery with mechanically important traits may not
 be used in this fashion.
Note: At the GM's discression, it can be a full moon out,
 causing all Saiyans to transform automatically as a pre-round
 action. They still need to pay the associated Ki and END cost.
 Example: A SSJ2 Half-Saiyan that goes into Oozaru form
 would gain +70% STR, +20% all other stats and +2 to their
 HP/Ki modifier. They would use +120% STM for purposes of
 determining their hitpoints only.
 (Phys) Tail Training This power can not be taken until level
 5. It allows the Saiyan to use their Tail in combat. Their tail is
 considered a basic Hand to Hand attack which has a +1 to
 Strike and inflicts 4d6 per level. Someone grabbing your tail
 no longer paralyzes you or reduces your STR and your Tail
 now has 10% of your Maximum HP in place of its original
 HP.
 (Ment) Super Saiyan This power can not be taken until
 level 6 Saiyan Half-Breeds have the uncanny ability to
 transform into something their full-blooded brethren struggle
 with. Maybe its the humanity that is added to the warrior
 spirit, but whatever it is it's a potent combination. In this
 form, a Saiyan's hair turns golden and stands up a bit and
 their pupils become green. Their aura turns a bright, flaring
 gold and you gain the following bonuses: +15% all stats
 (except INT) +1 HP Mod +1 Ki Mod
 Can Bite as a basic Melee attack, even in a grapple. This
 deals your STR/4+STR Mod + Misc Modifiers AP/SP
 Damage. Inside of a grapple the attack gains UP but may
 not benefit from Bulk.
 You may use the Mouthblast power even if you do not
 normally know it, and it deals 1d6*10 AP damage per
 level instead of normal.
 Oozaru can hold up to two people, one in each hand.
 When grappling in this way, each person can break out
 This costs 10% of your maximum base (no superforms!)
 END.
 (Ment) Ultimate Super Saiyan This power can not be taken
 until level 7, and requires Super Saiyan. The Ultimate Super
 Saiyan or the 'Ascended Saiyan'. This form is similar to Super
 Saiyan, but more physically powerful and unbalancing,
 against half of the Oozaru's STR to get free. If one escapes
 and the Oozaru has an action between the Escapee and
 the remaining Defender, the second person must deal
 with the Oozaru's full strength as normal. With the Goon
 unique, this is raised to 3/4 STR for two Defenders.
 An Oozaru may never be the defender in a grapple except
 if the attacker is similarly sized. This means another
 Oozaru, the Wyrm Dragon, or some NPCs.
 The Oozaru may not use superspeeds when maintaining
 two Defenders in a grapple or benefit from move-speed
 dependent bonuses.
 While the Oozaru grapples a single opponent, he may
 make strikes against people outside of the grapple as well
 as parry, dodge or block. You may also use superspeeds
 for attacks or defenses originating outside of the grapple.
 This Superform -stacks- additively with Super Saiyan,
 Ultimate Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan 2, and Super Saiyan
 3 but the bonuses to all stats except INT are reduced by
 10%.
 When you attack or attempt to end combat while anyone
 else is nearby, roll (Your Control Chance)-1d100. On a
 result of 0 or higher, nothing happens. On a result of 1 or
 higher, randomize the target of the attack. You may attack
 allies in this fashion, although friendly Oozaru may be
 exempt at that attacker's wish. If you were trying to end
 combat, then you must use an attack instead, which may
 not be a basic attack, Jumpkick or Eyebeams unless only
 basic attacks are available.
 sacrificing their ability to move. In this form, a Saiyan's hair
 will become a bit more spiky and he becomes more muscular.
 You gain the following bonuses: +25% STR +15% MNT and
 STM +10% DEX and SPD
 Use STR/4 as your STR Modifier
 This costs 10% of your maximum base (no superforms!)
 END.
 (Ment) Super Saiyan 2 This power can not be taken until
 level 11, and requires Ultimate Super Saiyan. This form is a
 perfected version of USSJ. The Saiyan's hair stands straight
 up and grows a bit longer. Unlike USSJ, however - they retain
 their speed and maneuverability and get maybe even stronger.
 This transformation may only be activated while Super
 Saiyan or Ultimate Super Saiyan is active. +25% All Stats
 (except INT) +2 HP Mod +2 Ki Mod
 This costs 20% of your maximum base (no superforms!)
 END.
 (Ment) SSJ Training This power can not be taken until level
 12, and requires Super Saiyan 2 You have perfected your
 mastery over your transformations. This grants you the
 following benefits
 Super Saiyan may be activated pre-round and costs no
 Endurance to transform into. This does not affect
 advanced forms of Super Saiyan.
 As an action taken while in Ultimate Super Saiyan, you
 may alter the form's bonuses--setting their SPD/DEX
 modifier between +10% and -100%. For every 1% of SPD
 and DEX you sacrifice you gain +2% STR. You may take
 this action even if you are in a Capture ball, stunned, or
 otherwise incapacitated You may not do this while Oozaru
 is active or while Grappling.

Zargonian
 Zargonians typically look like attractive humans with one or
 two major differences. This alien race finds its ancestry
 shared with a race of reptiles, and have yet been able to purge
 themselves of all reptile DNA. Because of this, they still share
 some traits of their reptilian ancestry. Zargonian skin
 typically comes in varying shades of green. The lighter the
 green, the more desirable the Zargonian. Conversely, their
 hair comes in shades of green as well - however if the hair
 and skin do not contrast, the Zargonian is considered ugly
 and undesirable by his or her people. Their eyes come in
 various shades of yellow and orange, with rare cases being
 spotted of green or hazel. Any Zargonian worth his weight in
 gold will go to great lengths to always look his or her best.
 Beauty is only skin deep, however. Each and every member
 of the Zargonian populace is capable of transforming into a
 hideously ugly monster, perhaps a physical embodiment of
 their own vanity. Most loathe to show this monster, but when
 they do your best bet is to run away. Once a Zargonian has
 gone through the great lengths to transform and show you his
 or her inner self, they'll most likely want to make sure you
 never tell anyone what you've seen.
 Some say that the Zargonians came into the service of the
 Icers hoping to learn how to perfect their transformation
 skills. But few actually believe that the Zargonians weren't
 conquered by the more war like race and forced into slavery.
 Average Height: 5'8" - 6'4" (172-193 cm)
 Average Weight: 150-250 pounds (68-113 kg)
 Life Span: 120-140 years.
 Interesting Traits: Occasionally Zargonians are born with
 scales on various parts of their bodies, throwbacks of their
 reptilian alien ancestry. Most Zargonians opt to have these
 scales removed, leaving patches of scar tissue where they
 used to be. This is very rare, however, and is not a desired
 trait among the race. Also, Zargonians love mirrors, and will
 often carry one on hand.
 Example: Zarbon.

 (Ment) Zargonians are usually found to be arrogant or
 confident of their power and abilities, often having to prove
 their skill when fighting outnumbered - because of this they
 are left to let the beast rampage against any that oppose
 them. When you're outnumbered in a Team Battle, the
 Zargonian receives +1 Strike/Parry/Dodge/Initiative per
 additional opponent beyond the first, to a limit of 4. In
 addition to this, they gain +5*level to all damage types (not
 Telekinetics) per additional opponent, to a limit of 4
 additional opponents.-=( Racial Powers )=
(Phys) Monstrous Form This transformation is used by
 Zargonians only when losing, typically. As almost all
 Zargonians despise the way they look while they're in it. A
 Zargonian can't transform until they reach 75% of their
 Maximum HP, though they can transform instantly when
 reduced to 75% HP reflexively or they can wait until later and
 use an action to transform. The Zargonian will remain in this
 form until the end of combat, even if their regeneration takes
 them back above 75% HP.
 This form grants the Zargonian the following:-10% MNT
 +50% STR
 +10% DEX
 +10% STM
 +10% SPD
 +level*3 resistance
 This form does not cost END or Ki
 This form does not suffer from experience penalties.
 *This form is a superform and cannot be stacked with
 statboosters.
 (Phys) Omega Bulk Up This power can be taken anytime
 after Monstrous Form is acquired. This power can only be
 used when in Monstrous Form and is used to enhance a non
Combo HtH attack. The attack gains +5 to its Strike roll, the
 damage also becomes Armor Piercing and Shield Piercing.
 This power can only be used once per round and costs 8
 Endurance. This Power is compatible with other forms of
 Bulk-Up.

High Races
 Androids
 Androids are sentient machines, constructed either from
 scratch or by heavily modifying an existing organism. In
 either case the result is a robotic warrior with amazing power
 capable of far more than a normal human. For hundreds of
 years, the Neoverse has been thriving to create artifical
 intelligence for good, evil and everything inbetween. It took
 many, many years but a group of scientists finally made a
 breakthrough: A fully sentient machine. It was capable of
 amazing feats that no human could possibly do without
 intense training - travel in space being the most prominent.
 Fortunately for the Neoverse, these scientists rarly shared
 how the managed to do it, because the Androids rebelled 
unable to be controlled by petty humans. It was because of
 this that the creators decided to stop making them. But, from
 time to time someone comes across the blueprints and re
creates an android, adding personal touches to them be it
 impressive shielding capabilities or extreme firepower.
 Regardless of how, when or why they were created, they are
 potent warriors with amazing power.
 Average Height: Varies drastically based on creator's
 preferences. Average Weight: Several tons. Life Span:
 Theoretically, androids are ageless. But, few models continue
 working after a thousand years. Interesting Traits: Man-made
 machines, limitless options, mostly human-based (humans
 being generally the only ones with the technology to create
 them) but there are exceptions.
 Example: Androids 16 through 20.

 LP: 7 x STR
 High Races receive a free Fighting Style at level 1. This
 also counts towards their INT limit. Pick six powers at level
 1. You gain two powers per level up, which may not be picked
 from the same tree. Every even level (2, 4, 6, etc) High Races
 gain an extra power (three, instead of two).
 Racial Features (Ment) Androids can not take any powers
 from the Ki Awareness or Powering Up trees. If they would
 normally gain a Ki Awareness power, they instead gain an
 Offensive Ki power, a Powering Up power instead gives them
 a Defense Ki power. The powers Rest and Rejuvenation are
 not considered to exist for Androids, meaning they can still
 get higher-level powers from those trees. Androids can not
 learn Telekinetic powers, and schools that give TK powers
 are simply lost. Androids may not choose the Enhanced
 Awareness or Psionicist uniques.
 (Phys) Since Androids are machines, they can not be
 detected by any form of Ki Sense. Scouters give a location
 and direction, but not any powerlevel. Androids themselves
 have a built-in scouter, with a success chance of (60+Int)%,
 and an internal generator that grants them level*10 Ki
 regeneration per action. Androids can communicate across
 any distance for free with any scouter or dwelling with the
 communicator add-on.
 (Phys) Androids have no Stamina score and no Endurance.
 Costs of 1 Endurance are ignored, but everything else
 (including being parried) causes them to lose 15 Ki per point
 of Endurance it would normally cost. If a ki cost is multiplied,
 it is worked out before the additional 'endurance' cost is
 added as ki. If they ever reach 0 Ki, they pass out - just as if
 they'd run out of Endurance.
 (Phys) Whenever an Android's Stamina would go up from a
 player-taught school which gives no bonus to Strength, they
 instead add the Stm bonus to their Str score. Bonuses from
 uniques work the same way. In any other situation, unless
 otherwise specified, all gains of Stm are simply lost.
 (Phys) Androids can survive in normally-intolerable
 environments (such as Space, or Underwater), as they are
 machines. They do not need to breathe or sleep, and are
 immune to the power Choke.
 (Ment) An Android's artificial intelligence allows them to
 memorize and analyze things far better than a living person
 can, though they're often somewhat uncreative. All of their
 invents have a base of 35 points, instead of 30.
 (Phys) Androids, being the pure essence of technology,
 have the ability to upgrade themselves over time to improve
 their performance. An Android may select a new upgrade
 from the next page on every odd level. (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc).
 (Phys) Since Androids are machines, they have a harder
 time improving themselves during battle than living beings.
 Statbooster invents for Androids start out granting 1 stat
 point per 9 invent points (instead of 7). Since they have no
 STM score, Weighted Clothing for Androids is based off of a
 total of their combined MNT and STR.
 (Ment) When charging a Ki invent, Androids put double the
 Ki they would naturally regenerate into the invent, but do not
 regain any Ki on the actions they're charging. They can not
 add Ki to their Ki pool this way, but they do not have the
 normal level*3 limit to how many times they can charge per
 battle.
 (Phys) Androids are built to be as efficient as possible in
 their movements. They gain HP/600 to all strikes and
 dodges. Temporary increases to maximum HP, such as
 through superforms or statboosters, does not affect this.
Racial Powers
 (Phys) Zero Shift You cannot take this power until you've
 reached level 5. This power modifies an android's existing
 propulsion system, allowing them to create a controlled,
 temporary overload which results in a short burst of amazing
 speed and maneuverability. In game terms, this gives the
 android +5 to their strike or dodge rolls for an action. This
 even applies to telekinetic attacks and stacks with any used
 superspeeds. Zero Shift costs 5% of your maximum Ki to
 use, +5% of your maximum Ki per previous use during the
 same round.
 (Phys) Defense Matrix This power can not be taken until
 level 8. Once per battle, the Android can project an
 exceptionally powerful force field, which can protect against
 virtually any attack. As it's not an actual shield, this power
 works normally against SP, UP and US attacks. However, it
 can not be used in conjunction with any type of blocking or
 shielding and resistance does not apply when using it. This
 power divides the damage taken from an attack by 8 and
 functions against all attacks in a combo situation. Against
 attacks which do not deal damage, Defense Matrix stops
 them entirely. It costs 300 Ki to use and can not be used in a
 grapple and it is not reflexive. Template: [(Damage taken 
Armor)/8]
 (Ment) Completed Programming This power can not be
 taken until level 10. When it is taken, the Android reaches the
 pinnacle of their performance; refining themselves to truly
 staggering levels. The exact nature of what this power gives
 depends on the Android's model and is shown in each
 Models' section.
 Android Models On Creation you choose one of the listed
 models which functions like a racial class.
 1) No Model A basic Android, with no specialized functions.
 Their lack of specialization gives room to more generalized
 improvements and allows them to be a little more resilient.
 You gain the following +4 All Stats (except STM) +1 HP and
 Ki Modifier.
 Additional +1 to their HP or Ki Modifier, chosen on
 Creation.
 Gain a free upgrade at levels 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 in addition
 to the normal choices.
 Completed Programming: As an action, you may gain the
 benefits of any other Android Model Type until the conflict
 ends or you use this power again. You may use this power
 as a Pre-Round action by lowering your APR by 2 for the
 round. You do not gain their Completed Programming
 bonus, stat modifiers, HP mods, Ki mods, or bonus
 powers.
 2) Barrier Model This type has a unique shield generator,
 which allows them to create extremely potent barriers of
 energy. You gain the following: *+3 All Stats (except STM)
 Table of
 Contents
 +1 HP and Ki Modifier.
 You may spend up to 25 Ki per level on a Reflexive racial
 shield. You stop 4 damage for each Ki spent, or 2 damage
 for each Ki spent against SP attacks. You may use it an
 unlimited number of times per round.
 Completed Programming: Your shield may stop UP
 damage at the rate of 1 damage per 1 Ki spent.
 Additionally, you may use each version of your shield
 (Normal, SP-Resistant, UP-Resistant) against a Combo.
 3) Energy Absorption Model These models have special
 crystals in the palms of their hands which can absorb energy
 they come in contact with. +5 STR, +2 all other stats (except
 STM) +2 HP Mod and -1 Ki Mod.
 You gain the Parry Blast power for free.
 While in control of a grapple, you may drain a victim's
 vitality as an action. This drains your Level1 END and
 Level10 Ki from your opponent, while the Android gains
 the drained Ki.
 When you use Parry Blast you do not suffer the normal -5
 penalty to the strike roll. Other strike penalties, such as
 against multi-attacks, apply normally. On a successful
 Parry Blast attempt, you gain all Ki spent on the attack
 (including from add-ons like PKU). Alternatively, you may
 recover 1 HP for every 2 Ki you would have absorbed.
 You have a seperate Ki Pool where all of your drained Ki
 goes, similar to a Charging Ki Pool. Ki may be spent from
 this pool freely.
 Completed Programming: Whenever you drain someone's
 Ki in a grapple, you get a cumulative +5% STR for
 purposes of Grapple Checks until the current Grapple
 ends. When someone uses Flare to break out of a grapple
 with you, you gain 10% of their Maximum Ki added to
 your Drained Ki pool. Finally, you may spend 500 Ki to
 lower your STR Mod divisor for the duration of one action
 or one Parry Blast (STR/5 becomes STR/4. STR/4
 becomes STR/3).
 112
4) Hell's Flash Model These Androids can remove their
 hands at the wrists, to reveal powerful energy cannons built
 into their arms. +5 MNT, +2 all other stats (except STM) +2
 Ki Mod and -1 HP Mod.
 Removing or re-attaching your hands may be done as an
 action or as a pre-round.
 While your arms are attached, you may launch them as
 part of a Hand-to-Hand attack that does not explicitly use
 a part of your body that isn't your fists and isn't a type of
 Grab. This allows you to use your Ki Strike in place of
 your Hand to Hand strike and your MNT in place of your
 STR. If you do this, your arms are unattached afterwards.
 While your arms are not attached, your Ki attacks are
 enhanced, gaining +3 Ki Strike and +80% Damage but
 costing 100% more Ki. Only the base Ki cost is increased,
 not the cost from anything else added to the attack. The
 powers Eyebeams and Mouthblast do not benefit from
 this. You may not use Hand to Hand or Sword attacks
 (including the Ki Attack from Ki Enhance) while your
 arms are unattached.
 Completed Programming: You may attach or unattach
 your arms as a non-action at the beginning of your turn.
 The added Ki cost is reduced to +50%.

Attack Template: (((Dice)(Mnt Mod)+Misc mods)1.4+PKU) Ki
 Cost: [(normal cost2)+pku]
 Android Upgrades Afterburners An android's propulsion
 system is modified, either by a few tweaks, a new cooling
 system or some good old engines strapped onto their back.
 This doubles an android's flight speed, but also doubles the
 amount of ki needed. If they're concerned about efficiency, the
 android can choose not to use this upgrade. If used in
 combat, this doubling is not applied to damage or
 strike/dodge modifiers, it only applies for chasing and
 escaping.
 Discern Power For this upgrade, a few modifications are
 made to how the android picks up power levels, allowing
 them to memorize a person's aura. There is no limit to how
 many people they can remember, basically, this lets you
 recognize people when you sense them, like a non-android
 could. You do not recognize any auras that you sensed before
 you had this upgrade, until you sense them with it.
 Enhanced Espionage Unit Requires four levels or more of
 Scouter Cloaking. With this upgrade, an Android can fine
 tune its generator to give off special, detectable ki signitures
 like the ones given off by actual people. In mechanical
 purposes, you're treated as though you're a normal human (or
 equivalent) with a power signature - producing a power level
 of [((Current HP + Current Ki)*(STR+DEX+SPD))/12]. While
 unconcious, you have a static powerlevel of 1% of your
 normal powerlevel and is representitive of your generator
 running 'idle'. You can turn this on or off, whenever you like.
 Turning this on in combat can allow your opponent to ki
 sense lock onto you as if they were fighting a normal warrior.
 Nano-Repair Systems With this upgrade, an android gains
 a colony of microscopic robots inside them which can repair
 damaged circuits and machinery all over its body. If an
 android suffers a critical hit and receives penalties because of
 it (basically, if a limb is broken or worse) the nano machines
 can repair it quickly outside of battle.
 When out of battle, the android can heal any broken,
 shattered, or lost body part within three real life hours. Since
 all their energy is going in to these repairs, they won't be able
 to regain any ki until the process is over. If an Android was
 KO'd from its Ki getting to 0, it must regen to at least 1 ki
 before Nano-Repair Systems take over. If the limb has been
 cut off, the android needs to find the lost body part in order to
 reattach it. They can create a completely new one, but this
 takes an entire Neo week in place of the three real life hours.
 Nanowave Telepathy With this upgrade an android can
 send out special transmissions that will play a message in the
 database of another android or scouter, that it has scouted.
 This creates a special two-way frequency of communication,
 that doesn't require a hidden Android to reveal its location.
 People with a scouter that has the communicator addon may
 also be targetted and respond.
 Scouter Cloaking With this upgrade, an android has
 various small modifications made to itself which conceal the
 energy it gives off just from functioning, which is designed to
 mask the emissions specific kinds of scouters look for. Each
 level of this blocks only a specific kind of scouter, so taking
 upgrade 4 would stop the android from being detected by
 level 4 scouters, but not level 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6 scouters. These
 upgrades do stack with each other.
 This counts as only one upgrade no matter how many
 times you've taken it and once you have done so it upgrades
 itself. You can have one level of this upgrade for every two
 levels you have and you don't have to take them in any
 specific order. This means that you could take ugprade 3 at
 level 1, upgrade 4 at level 4, upgrade 1 at level 6 and once you
 reached level 12 you would have all of them. This would
 make you impervious to all buyable scouters and give a total
 of -180% to other androids and Ghettis. It is automatically
 upgraded when you take it, so if you obtain it at level 9, it
 would start with four levels of the upgrade and get the fifth
 level the next time you level up and then the sixth normally, at
 level 12.
 1 - Level 1 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis. 2 
Level 2 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis. 3 - Level
 3 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis. 4 - Level 4
 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis. 5 - Level 5
 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis. 6 - Level 6
 scouters and -30% to Androids and Ghettis.

Solar Fiber When this upgrade is taken, the android replaces
 its hair or other exposed part with special fibers that gather
 solar and other energy from the surrounding area to help
 alleviate some of the stress on the android's generator.
 Because of this, the android is able to repair themselves
 much quicker, healing and regening ki at double the normal
 rate out of battle. This also cuts in half the time it takes for
 them repair critical effects out of battle if they have the Nano
Repair Systems upgrade.
 Scouter Jamming Requires four levels or more of Scouter
 Cloaking. This upgrade sends out a special frequency of
 transmission that can scramble any scouter and scanning
 device within a mile of the android producing it. Any scouter
 or scanning device in this area will not function and nothing
 inside it within it can be scouted or scanned: all it produces is
 a large blip of static. This upgrade can be turned on and off at
 will, though when it's on even the android that's producing it
 cannot use their scouter.
 Scouter Upgrades An android's built-in scanners are far
 from perfect, but on the other hand that means there's plenty
 of room for improvement. These upgrades improve the
 accuracy of the android's scanning ability, to the point where
 they can actually assess various parameters of a fighter
 outside of battle. There are five levels of this upgrade and it
 improves itself automatically so that its rank is equal to half
 the android's level. This means that at level 1, you'd have the
 first rank of it, you'd get the second at level 4 and so forth,
 until you finally got the fifth rank at level 10. It is
 automatically upgraded when you take it, so if you obtain it at
 level 9, it would start at the fourth level of the upgrade and get
 the fifth level when you reach level 10.
 For each level of this upgrade you have, you get +20% to
 your scouter's success rate. This means that if you were level
 eight and had this upgrade, you'd get +80%. Also, you may
 pick one stat other than Int for each rank of it you have.
 When you scan somebody (you must actually be within
 seeing distance of them and it counts as a sense roll for the
 limit of one roll per ten minutes) you will learn what they
 have in the stats you have ranks for.
 Combat Upgrades Accelerated Nano-Repair This upgrade
 requires the android to have Nano-Repair Systems before it's
 taken. Through the use of this upgrade, an android can
 drastically accelerate the speed at which their nano-machines
 work but it's not done very efficiently. This gives them level2
 HP regeneration per action, but causes them to lose level5 ki
 regeneration. This can be turned on or off pre-round or by
 spending an action. If the android has Solar Fibers, the cost
 for this upgrade is negated.
 Generator Enhancement This upgrade can not be taken
 until the android has Solar Fibers and takes up to two
 upgrade slots, which means that in most cases they would
 skip an upgrade and then get it the next time they received
 one. When taken, it increases an android's in-battle ki
 regeneration by level*5.

 Contents
 Suppression Coils While most Androids strive to improve
 themselves, some merely wish to be more like those around
 them. This upgrade provides Androids with the ability to
 scale their performance down if nessicary, saving energy as a
 nice bonus. Functioning similarly to the suppress power, the
 android reduces their strike and dodge by -1, their damage by
 10% and reducing their ki cost on everything by 5%, per
 penalty to a maximium of -1 per two levels. When paired with
 the Enhanced Espionage Unit, this causes your 'powerlevel'
 to also drop by 10% for each -1 penalty. The maximum
 penalty you may impose upon yourself is -10.
 Tactical Analysis Programming Requires level 3 or higher
 Scouter Upgrade. Once per round, you can spend an action to
 scan your opponent; revealing their current HP, Ki or
 Endurance. This upgrade can be taken up to three times 
each time it's taken, it lets you learn another aspect of the
 upgrade. When you have multiple upgrades, you discern all of
 the selected attributes together.
 Advanced Targeting Computer Requires: Level 5 You may
 use your scouter to lock on to a target as a pre-round action.
 This gives you a cumulative +1 bonus on all strike and dodge
 rolls on that target for the rest of the combat, to a maximum
 of +Level/2.
 Multi-Lock Systems Requires: Advanced Targeting
 Computer When you use your Advanced Targeting Computer
 to lock on to someone, you may lock on to any number of
 combatants

Bojackackan
 Having wandered the Neoverse for thousands of years, or so
 is the story, the mighty Bojackans have nowhere to call home.
 Legend has it their homeworld was destroyed in the War
 against Hell, others say that they never had a homeworld 
they are and always have been the Pirates of the Neoverse.
 Regardless, they are a force to be reckoned with, as they
 work amazingly well in teams, taking awesome advantage of
 the distraction that their teammates provide. Not only are
 they great in teams, but they have some other interesting
 abilities that can increase their potential in battle.
 Average Height: 6'4" (193 cm)
 Average Weight: 300 pounds (136 kg)
 Life Span: 100-150 years.
 Interesting Traits: Blue skin, brightly coloured hair, pointy
 ears, most are space pirates.

 (Ment) Bojackans are skilled combatants and know how to
 take advantage of an enemies hesitation. If they are the first
 to act in a round, they receive +5 to all Strikes and Dodges for
 the rest of that round. In team fight situations as long as a
 Bojackan beats all opponents initiative rolls, they gain this
 bonus.
 (Ment) Bojackans are best suited to work in groups with
 other warriors. If fighting with a team, they gain +1 to all
 Strikes and Dodges for every ally on their side, to a maximum
 of +3. Split form powers do not count for this.-=( Racial Powers )=
(Ment) Energy Strands This power can not be taken until
 level 3. Once per round, Bojackans can fire thin strands of
 pure energy to entangle and hold an opponent. This costs 5%
 of the Bojackan's maximum Ki, and counts as a Ki attack with
 a -4 penalty to strike that may not be parried. If the Bojackan
 hits, then the target is grappled by the strands. The target and
 the strands themselves are considered grappled and unable
 to defend themselves, but the Bojackan is not. The strands
 have Level100 HP, Level10 Damage Resistance, are immune
 to Hand-to-Hand attacks, and use the Bojackan's MNT/2
 instead of STR/2 for all grapple checks. The Strands
 dissipate if they become the defender in the grapple. The
 Bojackan may not use Energy Strands against those already
 involved in a normal melee grapple, nor may someone who is
 caught in the Strands be grappled normally (the strands
 hurt!). While holding someone, the Bojackan may only take
 the following actions.
 Crush: [MNT/2] UP/AP damage, and the victim loses 5 ki
 per level of the Bojackan. This move keeps the target held.
 Strands Throw: [(MNT/2+mnt mod)+misc ki mods] UP
 damage, and Stuns the target (even if they take no
 damage). This move releases the target.
 Strands Slam: [(MNT+mnt mod)+misc mods] UP damage.
 This move releases the target.
 Bojackans may work together when using Energy Strands.
 If one Bojackan has someone grappled with his Energy
 Strands, any other Bojackans in combat may choose to use
 their own Energy Strands against the target, which
 automatically hit. Each additional Bojackan who adds their
 strands causes the original users' MNT to be considered 25%
 higher any time the victim attempts to break free, add their
 own Strands' HP to the ones grappling the victim. Only the
 original user of Strands can make attacks against the victim,
 but on each of the additional Bojackan's actions, the victim
 loses 5 ki per level of that Bojackan. The Bojackan does not
 gain this ki, it is only lost.
 (Phys) Superform This power can not be taken until level 5.
 It allows the Bojack to transform into a stronger state, which
 grants the the following bonuses:
 +20% Mnt
 +20% Str
 +20% Dex
 +20% Stm
 +20% Spd
 This costs 10% of your base (no superforms!) END.
 At level 7, the strength of their Superform increases,
 granting +2 to their Hp and Ki Modifiers. At level 11 it
 increases again; no longer costing any endurance to activate
 and it can then be activated as a preround action.

 encasing their brain, and often several such bubbles are
 located elsewhere on the body. These androgynous beings
 may even change gender aspects in between forms, though
 they are asexual beings. Icers live the longest life of any
 known race, and rarely reproduce. This is to keep the
 population of their planet down, and because they simply
 have no desire to unlike most races. This latter part might be
 due to the warrior-like society of the proud race where they
 fight one-on-one battles to ascend in society, even the
 Emperor is capable of being challenged for his position by
 any other Icer at anytime.
 Average Height: Varies Average Weight: Varies Life Span:
 6,000 years. Interesting Traits: They are a kind of
 shapeshifter and can control almost exactly what they look
 like to some extent; nicknamed "Changelings". They own
 countless planets, hundreds of slave races, and have a small
 population of near 500.
 Example: Freiza (Freeza).

 HP: 8 x STM+25 xlevel
 KI: 14 x MNT+25 x level
 LP: 7 x STM
 High Races receive a free Fighting Style at level 1. This
 also counts towards their INT limit.
 Pick five powers at level 1. You gain two powers per level up,
 which may not be picked from the same tree.
 Every even level (2, 4, 6, etc.) High Races gain an extra
 power (three, instead of two).-=( Racial Features )=
(Phys) Icers can survive in almost any environment,
 including deep sea, extreme temperatures and outer space.
 They are also immune to the Grapple power Choke.
 (Phys) Icers can survive even after losing all of their LP.
 Despite their reputation of being immortal they can actually
 be killed, its just incredibly difficult. Icers have Sub-Lifepoints
 equivalent to Level*300. An Icer appears dead when they are
 in this state and their Sub-LP regenerate at the same rate as
 normal Lifepoints. Not having a head or being inside of the
 sun becomes a problem, but typically no one has any reason
 to think you're alive the first time you 'die' - unless they're
 another Icer or have been told of this unique ability by an Icer.
 (Phys) Icers can attack with their tail. It is considered a
 HtH attack which has a +1 to Strike and deals 4d6 per level.
 Once per two rounds you may perform an unexpected
 surprise attack with your tail, gaining +(Level) to its strike,
 dealing +100% Base Damage and granting it AP/SP.
 (Ment) Icers gain +1 to all types of damage per 25 Max Ki
 they have (Charging does not affect this).
 (Phys) Icers have a tough layer of skin. Some have actual
 armor plates. Regardless, they have a Natural Armor value of
 STM*4.
 (Ment) Icers are able to project their will as a powerful
 forcefield. This is a Reflexive Natural Shield with MNT*4 HP.
 The Ki is almost a second layer of skin so SP attacks function
 against the Natural Shield as though the attack were AP and
 the Natural Shield were Armor. It may not stop UP Attacks.
 (Phys) Select one Affix from the list below. You gain that
 Affix as a racial feature.
 (Phys) Icers begin in "Form One" and gain additional
 Forms as Superforms as they level up, as detailed below. As a
 pre-round action an Icer may advance one form. By spending
 an action, an Icer may advance any number of forms. An Icer
 may not enter a lesser form until after the current conflict is.
 The first time an Icer advances a single form (Form One to
 Form 2, Form 3 to Form 4, etc) during any round they ignore
 any EXP penalties. Every time an Icer advances one or more
 forms, they restore 20% of their Maximum END, half of their
 maximum Natural Shield and half their maximum Natural
 Armor after adjusting their stats.-=( Racial Powers )=
(Ment) Piercing Blast At level 1 an Icer automatically gains
 this power. This is an extremely powerful Ki attack that many
 Icers know how to use. It is a Ki attack with a -2 to its Strike
 roll. If it hits, it deals 1d610 damage, +1d610 Damage per
 level of the Icer and costs 25 Ki per 1d610. The attack is
 always Armor Piercing and Auto Critical. It gains Shield
 Piercing at level 4 and becomes Double Auto Critical at level
 9. Shield Piercing increases the cost to 30 Ki per 1d610, but
 the Icer can choose not to use the Shield Piercing effect on
 the blast (must declare if you're not). The blast can not be
 countered and can only be used once every two rounds.
 (Phys) Second Form An Icer may not select this Power
 until level 3. Icers have the ability to change forms and
 become stronger. All stat changes from shifting forms are
 based on stats in their Base Form (Form 1). An Icer may
 activate a Form as an Action. Forms may be skipped (as in,
 you can go straight from Form 1 to Form 5) as long as you
 know the proper superform. However, each Superform may
 only be activated once, and an Icer may not "downgrade"
 their form until after the current combat. As a pre-round
 action you may advance one Form (Form 1 to Form 2, Form 2
 to Form 3, etc) but you may not skip forms as a pre-round
 action. This form grants the following bonuses:
+10% All Stats, except INT.
 When you select this power, you have 10 points to spend
 to increase your stats further. Each point spent increases
 a stat by +1%, to a maximum of +5%. Once selected, this
 choice may not be changed. INT may not be increased.
 Select one Form Affix from the list below when you
 purchase this Superform. You gain that Affix's benefit.
 (Phys) Third Form An Icer may not select this Power until
 level 6 and they must know Second Form. Icers have the
 ability to change forms and become stronger. All stat changes
 from shifting forms are based on stats in their Base Form

 to customize your form. You select one affix per form, which
 applies to that form and all later forms. Your choice in Affix is
 permanent once selected. Each affix may only be selected
 once.
 Your Natural Shield may stop UP attacks as though they
 were AP and it now ignores the SP quality of attacks
 completely. It also gains +MNT*1 to its current and
 maximum value, before regenerating.
 Your Natural Armor (not Resistance!) may treat AS, IA and
 UP attacks as instead having AP, at your option. Its
 current and maximum value also increases by +STM*2,
 before regenerating.
 Your form develops a natural weapon of some sort that
 may be used like a sword. It deals 2d10 SP damage per
 level. It gains +2 Strike in Form 3 and AP in Form 4.
 You gain a +Level*10 bonus to all damage rolls.
 You have developed a unique attack based on your new
 form. You gain a new Level 1 Ki, Sword or Hand-to-Hand
 personal invent with 15 base Invent Points.
 Whenever your Natural Armor or Natural Shield stop
 damage, you reflect 10% of the damage prevent as UP/AS
 damage. This functions as Flaring, but works against Ki
 Attacks with no penalty.
 Your new body regenerates very quickly. It gains Level*3
 HP and Ki Regeneration.
 Your form has several sets of redundant muscles. They
 use STR/4 for their STR mod instead of the regular
 STR/5.

Your new form is capable of channeling the Icer's
 signature power, the Piercing Blast, through their hands.
 Piercing Blast may be delivered using your Hand to Hand
 strike or Ki Strike. It still uses the Ki Critical Hit table, but
 otherwise counts as its respective type of attack. In either
 form Piercing Blast may be used 2/2 rounds, gains a +2
 bonus to Strike and deals +25% Base Damage.
 Your form has an even longer and more prehensile tail
 than normal. Once per two rounds you may make a HtH
 strike with no penalty to wrap your tail around an
 opponent's throat and constrict them. This attack may not
 be parried. If successful, it counts as if you hit them with
 Grab and immediately Choked them, per the relevant
 powers. The victim loses 1 END on each of their actions
 until they break this grapple. This does not consume one
 of Grab's UPR.

Kibitain
 Kibitain are tall humanoids with black eyes, white hair, long
 pointed ears, and pink or red skin. They are traditionally the
 defenders of good and servants of the Kaioshin. Though it is
 uncommon, kibitain can also serve evil and demonic forces.
 The Kaioshin originally created the Kibitain and gave them
 free will to make them more useful. Eventually they began to
 breed amongst themselves, causing them to become a full
fledged race of their own (the Kaioshin still create them,
 albeit rarely). This is also where the schism between the
 'good' kibitain and the 'evil' kibitain began.
 There is a special bond between a Kibitain and any power
 they choose to champion, something of the greater's power
 becomes symbiotic with the Kibitain's own. This does not
 weaken either, but some Kibitain claim it is the source of all
 their powers. There are few kibitain that choose to serve
 nothing.
 Kibitain live forever as long as the power they serve exists,
 aging no further past adulthood during the time. If the higher
 power ceases to be, or they sever ties to it, they begin to age
 normally. If they bond with another higher power, their aging
 halts but is not reversed.
 Average Height: 6'8" (203 cm) Average Weight: 185 pounds
 (83 kg) Life Span: Ageless, or 200-250 years (see above).
 Interesting Traits: Kibitain is, both, the singular and plural
 name for the race. Kibitain, of both genders, wear earrings as
 accessories.
 Example: Kibito.

(Ment) Kibitian can live in the mortal realm and in the
 afterworld (Heaven and Hell). They can not teleport others
 with them into Heaven or Hell unless those beings are
 allowed to be there.
 (Ment) Kibitian gain +1 to all Damage per 25 Max Ki they
 have (Charging does not affect this).
 Table of

 (Ment) Kibitian can never have their free will taken from
 them, and are immune to any abilities that attempt to do so.
 (Phys) Kibitian have keen ears, which grant them +1 APR,
 and +3 to Initiative rolls.
 (Ment) Kibitian begin with the Sense Ki and Sense Path
 Powers.
 (Ment) When a Kibitian fights an opponent of a Path
 opposite to their own (Order vs Chaos or Mercy vs
 Retribution, Balance has no opposite), they gain +(Level) to
 all Strikes and Dodges, to a maximum of +8 and +level*10 to
 all Damage. If they fight someone from a path other than
 their own that is not on the opposite path, a member of the
 pathless or someone whose path is unsensible, then they get
 half of those bonuses (rounded down).
 (Ment) Kibitians gain additional schools for free at levels 1,
 5, 10 and 15. If they do not have the INT to learn another
 school then this takes them temporarily above their limit, but
 may delay learning future schools. Kibitians can not know
 more than one school for every 9 INT they have.

(Ment) Kai Kai At level 1 a Kibitain automatically gains this
 power. Kibitian can teleport. It costs 25% of his normal,
 maximum Ki to use this power and the Ki cost can never be
 altered by any powers, including Suppress Ki. When used in
 battle, it grants the Kibitian a (MNT/5) bonus to a Strike or
 Dodge roll. Up to one other person may be brought with the
 Kibitian if they are physically touching (usually, this means
 they are in a grapple) by paying 25% of their maximum Ki as
 well. This lets a Kibitian use KaiKai to dodge an attack from
 outside the grapple even if they are being grappled and allows
 them to help other people escape (see IT/Kai Kai escaping,
 below). The other person need not be willing, but they do get
 a break attempt (even Flare Break) to escape the grapple if
 they are unwilling. If they are willing, they may pay the Ki cost
 themselves.
 Unlike Instant Transmission, this power does not require
 the Kibitian to lock onto another person's Ki before
 teleporting and can be used to teleport to any location the
 Kibitian knows of. However, a safety feature prevents them
 from teleporting themselves (or others) into hazardous
 environments, like deep space. This power can not be used
 with Superspeeds.-- IT/Kai Kai Escaping Before battle has started, if someone
 attacks you, you can not teleport away to avoid combat
 altogether. When you wish to leave a scene, declare you're
 doing so and check noone intends to stop you. If they do wish
 to stop you or attack you, initiative is rolled as normal. Your
 first action you get, you may attempt to teleport away and
 declare as normal. Anyone who wishes to attack you may
 make any basic attack or basic discharge with addons as
 normal, against a single dodge with your bonus from IT/Kai
 Kai.
 If you dodge their attack, you successfully escape. If they
 hit you, you have failed to escape and take damage. Even if
 you reduce that damage to 0, you fail to teleport. It must be
 your action to teleport away and if you teleport and the
 person you're fighting is capable of teleporting (Kai Kai/IT,
 not by using a Superspeed), then they may follow you, even if
 it's outside of their normal sense range.
 Failure to teleport away from combat still costs the power's
 normal amount of Ki and endurance.
 If you use freeze or temporal distortion, it only allows you
 to avoid a single attack not all of them.
 (Ment) Lay on Hands Taking this power requires the
 Kibitain to be level 3. By touching themselves or another
 person, a Kibitian can heal them. The Kibitian can heal
 someone for [(2d610 per level+Mnt Mod+level10)] HP,
 spending 25 Ki per 2d6*10. A person can only be healed by
 Lay on Hands once per day.

Saiyan
 Saiyan warriors are recognized throughout the Neoverse as
 ruthless mercenaries and powerful warriors. Though they
 seem like regular Human Beings, they have a love for battle
 matched by none. Though they look like your average human,
 they have a few key differences - namely the fact that they
 have a monkey-like tail, which isn't just for looks. This gives
 them the amazing ability to transform into giant ape-like
 beasts under the right circumstances. And, if that wasn't
 enough, in times of great need, they are known to ascend,
 granting them amazing powers, making them rather difficult
 to defeat. Those born on Vegeta are sorted by their
 powerlevel, ranging from petty Low Class, to the mighty
 Super-Elite, and as such they are trained in the ways of
 battle.
 Average Height: 6'2" (187 cm)
 Average Weight: 260 pounds (117 kg)
 Life Span: 60-80 years. (Though, Saiyans stay in their prime
 until they're nearly sixty.)
 Interesting Traits: Monkey tail, barbarian-like warrior society
 ruled by King Vegeta, only race to ever revolt against the
 Icers and succeed. Though, very few have tried.
 Example: Goku (Kakarot), Vegeta, Nappa.

(Phys) All Saiyans have a tail which is a source of great
 power and great weakness for them. Their tail is required for
 both Oozaru tansformations (described below). However,
 when a Saiyan's tail is grabbed they become effectively
 paralyzed. The Saiyan can no longer take any actions, dodge,
 parry or counter and their Str is considered to now be 2 until
 their Tail is released. They are considered to be in grapple
 with their opponent during this.
 Table of
 Contents
 Grabbing a Saiyan's tail is treated as a normal grab
 attempt; specifying that you're targetting their tail. A Saiyan's
 Tail has 5% of the Saiyan's Max HP. It can be regrown in a
 rejuvenator, regardless of the Saiyan's age. Trying to strike a
 Saiyan's tail is at a -5 and you can not use Multiattacks or
 Combos (They are too inaccurate to properly aim). You can
 not target a Saiyan's tail in a Grapple, unless you went to
 Grab their tail when you began the Grapple. A Saiyan who
 loses their tail can have it regrown in a Neo Week.
 (Phys) Saiyans are fierce warriors, and gain +1 to all types
 of damage per 25 Max Ki they have. (Charging does not affect
 this)
 (Phys) Saiyans bred for conflict, giving them +HP/700 to
 all strikes and dodges. Temporary increases to maximum HP,
 such as through superforms or statboosters, does not affect
 this.
 (Ment) Saiyan's tenacity lets them get stronger after
 suffering a critical injury. They receive +25XP whenever you
 complete a fight (win or lose) with a Critical Effect that has a
 lasting penalty. That means a penalty that extends beyond a
 single fight, such as a broken arm, not a concussion.
 (Phys) Saiyans are able to go on and on and on and on,
 usually when everyone else would rather they just stop. Thus,
 they gain STM*1.5 END.-=( Racial Powers )=
(Ment) Stress Transformation This power is automatically
 gained at level 1. Saiyans may unlock a series of powerful
 transformations when their body and psyche are placed
 under extreme stress. This power may only be used if the
 Saiyan qualifies for Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan 2, or Super
 Saiyan 3. Once per Neo Week, as your action, you may
 declare you are under extreme stress, usually with
 accompanying RP. Roll ((Max HP - Current HP)/(Max
 HP)100 + (50 if you are in a deathmatch) + (50 for each ally
 that has died in this scene)+ Level10 - (100 if activating SSJ) 
(150 if activating SSJ2) - (200 if activating SSJ3) - 1d100). On
 a 0 or higher, you immediately transform at no cost and heal
 for 50% of your maximum HP, Ki and END. If it would be
 impossible for you to fail this roll, then you may use this
 power even if you have previously used your attempt for that
 week. You may not use this Power while in Oozaru form.
 Note: Either party abusing the Deathmatch option (for or
 against the Saiyan) will result in penalties levied by the staff.
 Keep to the spirit of the power.
 (Phys) Tail Training This power can not be taken until level
 2. It allows the Saiyan to use their Tail in combat. Their tail is
 considered a basic Hand to Hand attack which has a +1 to
 Strike and inflicts 4d6 per level. Someone grabbing your tail
 no longer paralyzes you or reduces your STR and your Tail
 now has 10% of your Maximum HP in place of its original
 HP.
 122
(Ment) False Moon This power can not be taken until level 3.
 This power allows the Saiyan to create a pale, shining orb in
 the air which mimics a moon. It allows a Saiyan to stare into
 its bright light and transform into their Oozaru form, even if
 the Planet they are on has no moon or if it's daytime. This
 costs 25% of your current END and Ki (including Charging
 Ki Pools). The transformation lasts until there are no
 opponents left (note that a rampaging Oozaru considers all
 non-Oozaru its enemy) or until the Saiyan's tail is cut off.
 Every Saiyan and Half-Saiyan in the combat who is capable
 of transforming into Oozaru does so, paying this power's cost
 even if they do not know it. This is a superform with the
 following traits: +50% STR +100% STM for purposes of
 calculating Hitpoints only.
 Can uproot a piece of the scenery (usually a tree) as a non
action to use as an improvised sword that has -2 Strike
 but deals 1d6*10 damage per level. Plot relevant scenery
 and scenery with mechanically important traits may not
 be used in this fashion.
 Can Bite as a basic Melee attack, even in a grapple. This
 deals your STR/4+STR Mod + Misc Modifiers AP/SP
 Damage. Inside of a grapple the attack gains UP but may
 not benefit from Bulk.
 You may use the Mouthblast power even if you do not
 normally know it, and it deals 1d6*10 AP damage per
 level instead of normal.
 Oozaru can hold up to two people, one in each hand.
 When grappling in this way, each person can break out
 against half of the Oozaru's STR to get free. If one escapes
 and the Oozaru has an action between the Escapee and
 the remaining Defender, the second person must deal
 with the Oozaru's full strength as normal. With the Goon
 unique, this is raised to 3/4 STR for two Defenders.
 An Oozaru may never be the defender in a grapple except
 if the attacker is similarly sized. This means another
 Oozaru, the Wyrm Dragon, or some NPCs.
 The Oozaru may not use superspeeds when maintaining
 two Defenders in a grapple or benefit from move-speed
 dependant bonuses.
 While the Oozaru grapples a single opponent, he may
 make strikes against people outside of the grapple as well
 as parry, dodge or block. You may also use superspeeds
 for attacks or defenses originating outside of the grapple.
 This Superform -stacks- additively with Super Saiyan,
 Ultimate Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan 2, and Super Saiyan
 3 but the bonuses to all stats except INT are reduced by
 10%.
 When you attack or attempt to end combat while anyone
 else is nearby, roll (Your Control Chance)-1d100. On a
 positive result, nothing happens. On a negative result,
 randomize the target of the attack. On a result of 1 or
 higher, randomize the target of the attack. You may attack
 allies in this fashion, although friendly Oozaru may be
 exempt at that attacker's wish. If you were trying to end
 combat, then you must use an attack instead, which may
 not be a basic attack, Jumpkick or Eyebeams unless only
 basic attacks are available.
 Note: At the GM's discression, it can be a full moon out,
 causing all Saiyans to transform automatically as a pre-round
 action. They still need to pay the associated Ki and END cost.
 Example: A USSJ Saiyan that goes into Oozaru form would
 gain +65% STR, +5% MNT/STM, +0% DEX/SPD. They
 would use +105% STM for purporses of determining their
 hitpoints only and they would benefit from STR/4.
 (Ment) Super Saiyan This superform may only be obtained
 through the "Stress Transformation" power. In times of great
 need; very powerful Saiyans have been known to transform
 into a legendary warrior above all - a Super Saiyan. In this
 form, a Saiyan's hair turns golden and stands up a bit and
 their pupils become green. Their aura turns a bright, flaring
 gold. You gain the following bonuses: +15% all stats (except
 INT) +1 HP Mod +1 Ki Mod
 This costs 10% of your maximum base (no superforms!)
 END.
 (Ment) Ultimate Super Saiyan This superform may only be
 choosen once you have obtained Super Saiyan by spending a
 power to aquire it. The Ultimate Super Saiyan or the
 'Ascended Saiyan'. This form is similar to Super Saiyan, but
 more physically powerful and unbalancing, sacrificing their
 ability to move. In this form, a Saiyan's hair will become a bit
 more spiky and he becomes more muscular. You gain the
 following bonuses: +25% STR +15% MNT and STM +10%
 DEX and SPD
 Use STR/4 as your STR Modifier.
 This costs 10% of your maximum base (no superforms!)
 END.
 (Ment) Super Saiyan 2 This superform may only be gained
 through the power "Stress Transformation" after learning
 Ultimate Super Saiyan. This form is a perfected version of
 USSJ; the Saiyan's hair stands straight up and grows a bit
 longer. Unlike USSJ, however - they retain their speed and
 manuverbility and get even stronger. This transformation may
 only be activated while Super Saiyan or Ultimate Super
 Saiyan is active. You gain the following bonuses: +25% all
 stats (except INT) +2 HP Mod +2 Ki Mod
 This costs 20% of your maximum base (no superforms!)

(Ment) SSJ Training This power requires Super Saiyan 2 You
 have perfected your mastery over your transformations. This
 grants you the following benefits
 Super Saiyan may be activated pre-round and costs no
 Endurance to transform into. This does not affect
 advanced forms of Super Saiyan.
 As an action taken while in Ultimate Super Saiyan, you
 may alter the form's bonuses--setting their SPD/DEX
 modifier between +10% and -100%. For every 1% of SPD
 and DEX you sacrifice you gain +2% STR. You may take
 this action even if you are in a Capture ball, stunned, or
 otherwise incompacitated. You may not do this while
 Oozaru is active or while Grappling.
 (Ment) Super Saiyan 3 This superform may only be gained
 through the power "Stress Transformation" after learning
 SSJ Training - additionally requiring the below note. You
 immediately lose the power "Stress Transformation", having
 achieved the pinnicle of Saiyan potential. Very few to none
 manage to attain this power. This is a Saiyan's most powerful
 form that anyone even remotely knows of. His golden, spiked
 hair grows and falls all the way down to his waist and his
 eyebrows completely disappear. You gain the following

 END.
 NOTE: SSJ3 requires being a Low-Class Saiyan, taking the
 Chosen Unique, or submitting a background for approval.-=( Racial Class )=
With the exception of some of the Super Elite, Saiyans do
 not fall into a category based on birth. Instead, babies have
 their potential power judged and then they are placed into
 one of three categories. At creation you may chose which
 class you want to start as.
 1) Low Class Example: Goku (Kakarot). Your class of
 Saiyans is from the lower rung of society, your power level
 was gauged to be very weak at birth and almost thrown out of
 the airlock. Though some use might come of you in society,
 just not with pride. Because of this you were trained to fight
 and sent on your way, but not to the same extent of your
 brethren. Often times you were over looked, and in the
 military your class is the eternal freshmen. Being part of the
 low class of the saiyan society and not raised to be warriors,
 these saiyans are initially weaker then their brethren.
 However, these saiyans have the potential to grow much
 stronger than their brothers, perhaps due to this strive to
 equalize or some genetic disorder. You gain the following
 modifiers
 Table of
 Contents-3 to All Stats
 While in any racial superform, you gain +5% all stats and
 +2 to your HP and Ki modifiers.
 Your level is considered two higher for the power "Stress
 Transformation."
 You may not learn the power "Tail Training."
 You may reach SSJ3 without the Chosen Unique or a
 Background.
 You have a 5% chance per level to control Oozaru
 (Maximum 100%).
 2) Normal Class Examples: Radditz, Bardock. You are the
 average Saiyan, trained from birth to make up the grunts of
 the military. Though not as strong as those above you, your
 people are very essential to the military and without them it
 would be nonexistent. You gain the following modifiers:
 +1 Power every Level-Up
 +2 Strike, Dodge and Initiative Rolls
 10% chance per level to control Oozaru (Maximum 80%)
 3) Elite Class Example: Nappa. At birth your power was
 gauged to be very exceptional. Because of this you were
 chosen to be a squad leader or perhaps a royal guard. You
 gain the following modifiers:
 +2 HP and Ki Mods, +1 to each at levels 6 and 12.
 STR/4 Resistance
 You begin with the Tail Training and False Moon powers.
 15% chance per level to control Oozaru (Maximum 90%)-=( Restricted Class )=- This class must be applied for with
 a character background and approved by the GM staff. There
 will be a maximum of one Royal Saiyan at any given time.
 4) Royal Saiyan or Super Elite Example: Vegeta. This
 category makes up one of two options. For those who had
 their power checked at birth, you are the top in the military.
 None stand above you, the generals and higher officers are all
 Super Elite. This class also covers those that are born into
 Royalty. The Royals fight the same as those below them, and
 on the battlefield none can match up to the wrath of a Saiyan
 Royal. You gain the following modifiers:
 +1 HP and Ki Modifiers
 +4 to all Stats
 After the fight in which you first unlock SSJ, you gain a
 permanent +2 bonus to all of your base stats, stacking
 with the above.
 After the fight in which you first unlock SSJ2, you gain a
 permanent +2 bonus to all of your base stats, stacking
 with the above.
 After the fight in which you first unlock SSJ3, you gain a
 permanent +2 bonus to all of your base stats, stacking
 with the above.
 You automatically start with the Tail Training and False
 Moon powers.
 Knowing another Saiyan has a more advanced Super
 Saiyan form than you (as in, seeing it in action with your
 own eyes) means you get a +50% bonus when using
 "Stress Transform."
 Your character starts with 1000 additonal credits.
 20% chance per level chance of controlling Oozaru. (Max
 of 100%)

Yarkon
 Yarkon's are not often seen, but their presence is known by
 the unique characteristic of physically absorbing energy from
 their surroundings in the form of light. What is more readily
 known is that they are often top-heavy, muscular, lizard-like
 creatures with a distinct lack of real eyes and insted a deep
 cavity of where they have something that could've been eyes
 in the past, now replaced by black discs that detect the
 existance of light and basic movement. Though it varies 
most are large and lumbering with almost frail, small lower
 bodies but sport large arms capable of cutting through their
 natural habitat to create caves. They are oppertunitists by
 nature - often working together as raiders to steal energy
 from neighbouring civilisations and using it to fuel their
 planet without such luxuries as a sun.
 Average Height: 6' (182 cm)
 Average Weight: 180 pounds (81 kg)
 Life Span: 300-500 years.
 Interesting Traits: Thrive in darkness, extremely advanced
 parasites.
 Example: Yakon.

 Yarkons gain 5 points to divide amongst their stats every level
 up and an automatic +1 to all stats every level up.
 HP: 14 x STM+30 x level
 KI: 12 x MNT+20 x level
 LP: 7 x STM
 High Races receive a free Fighting Style at level 1. This
 also counts towards their INT limit.
 Pick six powers at level 1. You gain two powers per level up,
 which may not be picked from the same tree.
 Every even level (2, 4, 6, etc.) High Races gain an extra
 power (three, instead of two).-=( Racial Features )=
(Phys) Yarkons have only vestigial eyes. They can still
 detect the presence of light, but see their surroundings
 through other means. There are benefits, however. Yarkons
 are immune to the Taiyoken and Zanzoken powers and suffer
 no penalties for critical damage to their eyes. They also begin
 with the Sense Ki power.
 (Ment) Yarkons are evolved for battle, gaining +1 to All
 Damage per 25 Max HP they have.
 (Ment) Yarkons do not have access to the Taiyoken or
 Eyebeams powers. Should a school offer this power to a
 Yarkon, he may instead choose A Piece of home or an
 Offensive Ki power instead. They may learn higher ranked
 Offensive Ki Powers as though the power Eyebeams did not
 exist.
 (Phys) Yarkons are truly children of their planet:
 swallowing all light around them. Yarkons gain a special
 "Lightdrinker" Ki Pool that starts each combat at 0, but is
 filled by their racial features and powers. Ki from this pool
 may not be spent and if the amount of Ki in the Yarkon's
 Lightdrinker Ki Pool ever exceeds their (higher of maximum
 HP or maximum Ki)/2, then they lose the excess in HP. This
 is treated as a cost and may not be reduced. This pool is
 emptied between fights or when unconcious. Template:
 Yarkon loses [(Current Lightdrinker Ki) - (Higher of
 Maximum Ki or Maximum HP)/2] HP on each of their turns,
 minimum 0.
 (Phys) Yarkons grow fat on power of others and it's
 expelled violently through their pores. They add (Current
 Light Drinker Ki)/25 to all damage rolls, or twice that to all
 Hand-to-Hand damage rolls. They add (Current Light Drinker
 Ki)/250 to their Strike and Dodge Rolls.-=( Racial Powers )=
(Phys) Light Drinker A Yarkon automatically gains this
 power at level 1. A Yarkon may activate this power pre-round
 or as an action, but de-activating it takes an action. While
 active, the Yarkon drinks in all Ki-based light around them.
 Beyond diming the lights (but not enough to hamper vision),
 this causes the Yarkon to "drink in" all the Ki from incoming
 attacks. This improves their Damage Reduction by Level*3
 and they add the Ki cost of any incoming attack they take
 damage from or successfully parry to their Lightdrinker Ki
 Pool. This includes Ki spent on add-ons such as Bulk-Up,
 PKU or Superspeeds. The only way to prevent themselves
 from continuing to add to their Lightdrinker Pool every time
 they take damage or parry is to turn off this power by
 spending an action.
 (Phys) Metabolize Light A Yarkon automatically gains this
 power at level 1. As an action, a Yarkon may start to
 metabolize their Lightdrinker Ki into usable Ki that is added
 to their Charged Ki pool. This allows them to lower their
 Lightdrinker Ki by up to their Level*25 and then add the
 same amount to their Charging Ki Pool. This does not
 otherwise count as charging and you may not use this power
 to charge into invents.
 (Phys) Form Drinker You must be level 5 before taking this
 power. A true terror; this power is both the Yarkon's greatest
 strength and its greatest weakness. Activating or deactivating
 this power takes an action and when activated, the Yarkon
 must nominate one opponent. On that opponent's turn, if they
 are in or choose to activate a non-permanent Superform, they
 lose the Yarkon's Level1 in END and Yarkon's Level10 in Ki,
 while the Yarkon gains his Level25 in Ki to their Lightdrinker
 Pool. If the victim loses END or Ki from this, then the Yarkon
 rolls {40 + Yarkon's STM/2 - Victim's STM/2 - 1d100}. On a 0
 or higher, the victim loses all benefits from their superform
 until the beginning of their next action. This does not work
 against Oozaru. However, if False Moon was used the Yarkon
 may "drink" the Ki from it, destroying it. This grants the
 Yarkon 500 Lightdrinker Ki and causes all Oozaru to revert
 to normal. Note: Losing access to your superform does lower
 your current and maximum HP, Ki, Endurance, et cetera.
 This may result in the opponent falling unconcious. *Note:
 False Moons do, in fact, taste like false cheese.

 Contents

(Ment) A Piece of Home This power can not be taken until
 level 7. This power takes an action to activate or de-activate.
 While active, the Yarkon cloaks the entire area in night,
 preventing anyone from seeing. Beyond the obvious, non
Yarkons have a -(Yarkon's Level)/3 penalty to Strikes, Dodges
 and Taiyoken Saves. Whenever a non-Yarkon makes an
 attack, they succeed on a Taiyoken save or the attack
 automatically misses and the Yarkon may add the attack's
 cost to their Lightdrinker Ki Pool as though they parried it
 with Light Drinker. People may attempt to dispel the
 darkness on their action by using Taiyoken. The Yarkon must
 then succeed on a Taiyoken Save or this power immediately
 ends (although it may be re-activated). This power may not be
 used while the Yarkon is benefiting from a Superform or
 Statbooster. This costs the Yarkon 1 END and 25 Ki per
 general action (that means every APR that passes from the
 Yarkon and anyone else in the fight). *Note: The normal
 stacking bonus to Taiyoken saves applies to and based on -all
Taiyoken saves, even one made through this Power.

 You can only get a school (from this section) in one of two
 ways.
 1. Acquire it automatically due to race.
 2. Buy a school for 10 Reputation Points. This takes 4 Neo

 3. Acquire it through a Unique.
 Rules pertaining to Schools:
 All School Invents can only be used 1/2 Rounds unless
 stated otherwise.
 If you gain a power from a school and you already know it,
 you can learn a power from the same tree, but must follow
 the standard power rules. If you already have all the
 powers from that tree, you instead gain nothing.
 School invents like Kamehameha do not need to be

 This invent is unique and is used as a Defensive action.
 When your opponent declares an attack on you, you declare
 you're using Demon Punch as your reaction. This causes you
 to strike at your opponent before their attack goes off, forcing
 them to defend against your attack first. They can take any
 defensive action against Demon Punch, but after it's resolved,
 you can only block their attack - having thrown yourself off
 balance too much to try and dodge or parry. Perfect Block

 Invent Name: Taisha Charge Type: School UPR: 1/Battle
 Description: This power is a last-ditch defensive technique
 learned by a warrior to protect themselves after they fall in
 battle and continues to do so while unconcious. This power
 automatically activates whenever you receive enough damage
 to kill you. To your opponent; it has killed you. In reality, the
 technique is a shield that projects a false image and shrouds
 the user from detection, creating a 'false body' nearby that
 otherwise appears to be the real thing. This allows a
 malicious person all the freedom of mutiliating the corpse
 without it effecting the real body.
 Insted of dying, you are left with 1 LP and give off no power
 level. You recover once you have 1 HP and the image
 disappears.
 Only people with this invent are capable of spotting the real
 body; even pointing it out seems to leave others confounded.
 A subtle crimson aura surrounds a victim using this
 technique. But it doesn't work more than once, really. Once a
 person has 'killed' you, they won't make the same mistake
 twice and by that time they tend to include the immediate
 area in final attacks.
 Notes:
 If a race has Sub-LP, then this power activates when they
 run out of normal LP - effectively saving their Sub-LP
 from damage.
 Being told a person has this technique does not allow you
 to reconize it or go around it; you either have to have
 witnessed the person using it or have the technique itself.

 instead causes a flat loss of 50 Ki per level of the attacker,

 Endurance per strike after the first. Every extra hit consumes

 Rounds Description: You charge a massive amount of energy
 into your weapon, before unleashing a series of swings that
 gradually lead into a final, powerful and explosive attack and
 strike your opponent with it. Upon the final collision, the
 excessive energy is released as a violent fiery explosion
 against your target.
 You gain 1+level/2.5 (round down) in strikes when using
 this power, each strike is its own seperate roll. The final
 attack must hit to gain the true benefit of this manuver. You
 can only add bulk to the first strike and the first strike may
 only crit. Crits on other rolls simply autohit and add SP/AP if
 the sword doesn't already have it.
 For every strike before the last (level/2.5) that hits your
 target, you consume one use of Charge/Echarge/Hicharge
 (Limited by the powers you know, Megacharge may not be
 used). This cumulative damage is added to the end of your
 final attack like bulk. All of your attacks deal normal sword
 damage. The charges used counts against your per-battle
 maximum. This attack gains Flaming at level 8 on the final
 attack.

 Notes:
 Supreme Aura and Aura of Protection can be used
 multiple times (once per hit) against Eruption Blade
 because it's a single attack, not a Combo. Its damage rolls
 are separate, however meaning that any shield or aura
 which has a per-round limit (such as Shield Invents) can
 only be used against a single damage roll.
 The power Freeze avoids all strikes from this power.
 You can declare separate defenses against each hit of an
 Eruption Blade, but parries suffer the usual penalty for
 attempting to parry a Multiattack, which is applied to all
 parries made.
 You do not charge actions prior to using this attack,
 charges are simply consumed during it. If you do not have
 enough charges to meet your maximum strike potiential
 for this attack, you cannot use this attack.
 Final Ki Attacker does not apply additional damage to the
 Charge damage, nor does this attack decrease the counter

Personal School
 First you must have a Race or other effect that grants you a
 personal School. Usually, this means being a Martial Artist,
 Kaio, or Restricted. Often you can teach one or more people
 your special school, using the rules in the appropriate race
 nodes. Once you have permission to create a Personal
 School, you may do so by following these three easy steps:
 1. Determine Bonus Powers Select two Powers, not
 counting Fighting Style exclusive powers. You learn both
 of those powers, ignoring normal prerequisits. Whenever
 anyone else learns your school, they may select and learn
 one of those powers.
 2. Determine Stats You have 42 points to split among stats,
 with no more than 12 in any one category. Anyone -else
who learns your school gains only half of these stats,
 rounded up.
 3. Create School Invent When creating this school, you
 create a Personal Hand-to-Hand, Sword, Ki or Statbooster
 invent. This begins with 30 base points, and advances like
 a level 1 Invent, regardless of what level you learn the
 school. In addition to the normal options, your Personal
 School Invent gains a special "Invent Unique" appropriate
 for its category.
 Map the Unique out to level 10. After that, people are free
 to choose how to advance the Personal School unique as
 students invent new ways to use old tricks.
 SPECIAL If you learn a personal school with a Statbooster,
 you may "retrain" a statbooster you already know, changing it
 to something else. You may not retrain statboosters granted
 by your race.
 Invent Uniques:
 Hand to Hand:
 1) Smoldering Ashes Your attack lights the target aflame
 with your passion. On hit, the target takes 10% of the attack's
 pre-reduced damage on each of their turns for the attacker's
 level in actions. This added damage has any add-ons the
 original attack did (such as AP, SP, AC, et cetera). This
 damage may not be dodged or blocked, but barriers and other
 forms of defenses work normally.
 2) Martial Flow When performing any applicable combo,
 your invent can be used in place of any Hand-to-Hand attack
 that would normally be used there (ignoring any normal
 restrictions such as, for example, a move needing to be "any
 Hand to Hand attack that isn't an invent"). For example, using
 an HtH combo you could perform a Multi-Punch followed by
 this invent.
 3) Phantom Strike Your attack defies normal means of
 perception. Maybe you punch the air and your opponent gets
 hit, maybe you turn out the lights--something like that. The
 end result is, it can't be parried for one reason or another. As
 a bonus, this ignores all temporary penalties to strike (such
 as from critical effects or a Yarkon's Piece of Home).
 4) Bloody Knuckles Your attack can draw upon your own
 life energy to fuel it. When you declare this attack, you may
 sacrifice any % of your current HP. If you do, add +1 to the
 attack's strike per 20% of your maximum HP sacrificed, and
 make the attack deal +1% damage for each 1% of your
 current HP sacrificed. If the loss of this HP would put you at
 0 HP or below, you may still complete the attack, but
 immediately fall unconscious at the end of the attack. You
 may not sacrifice more than 100% of your current HP to this
 attack.
 Weapon:
 1) Rend the Spirit Your blade cuts not just flesh, but the
 very life force of anyone it strikes, while performing this
 technique. The victim loses Ki equal to the amount of
 damage they take, along with (total damage taken)/100
 Endurance. Due to the spiritual nature of the, brute force is
 less useful than usual; you may not use any Ki Body
 Enhancement Powers other than Bulking Aura on this invent.
 2) Dancing Blade If your attack misses, you may release
 your sword, at which point it will continue pursuing the
 intended on its own (via some sort of mystical spiritual
 whatever). In game terms, the weapon makes another strike
 roll for the invent at the start of each of your actions, for
 (level)/2 actions or until it hits, at the original target. You may
 not use your sword while it is occupied this way, though may
 spend an action to retrieve it. After it hits or the timer expires,
 it returns to you automatically (at the start of your next
 action). If the opponent uses freeze, then no more strike rolls
 are made. The sword does not benefit from any super speeds
 you used or critical effects you're suffering from, but
 otherwise uses the same strike bonuses you had at the time
 this attack was launched. If used with a sword multi-attack,
 the 'Dancing' feature only applies to the invent's final strike.
 3) Flash of Steel You may use your invent as a pre-round
 action, a maximum of once per battle. This benefits from any
 other pre-round effects you have active (and your opponent,
 similarly, receives any such appropriate benefits), and does
 not take up one of your actions in the round. Any uses-per
round or per-battle used count towards the round that is
 beginning.
 4) Bloodthirsty Steel You recover HP and Ki equal to 50%
 of the damage dealt.
 Table of
 Contents
 133
Offensive Ki:
 1) Spiritual Singularity When charging into your invent,
 you automatically charge twice per action (for twice as much
 damage added to it, and 2 uses towards your maximum
 number of charges per battle). However, devoting every ounce
 of ki you can into an attack comes with a downside: you may
 not spend any ki while charging this invent.
 2) Wellspring of Aura When you begin charging your
 invent, you acquire a special, SP-resistant barrier that has HP
 equal to 20% of your maximum Ki. It even absorbs US and
 UP damage, though they deal double damage to the barrier.
 Each action you spend charging your attack adds the amount
 of ki charged (but not bonus damage from Increased
 Charging, or 'extra' charges from sources like Golden
 Charge) to the barrier's health. While it remains, you may not
 be grappled and are immune to the Capture Ball power.
 When the barrier's HP is depleted, you can no longer charge
 your attack, and must fire it on your next action.
 3) Relentless Pursuit If your attack misses, you may
 'remote' it (as per the normal rules for that add-on) on later
 actions. This may be done a maximum of once per action, for
 any number of consecutive actions, until: the attack hits, you
 run out of ki, or you take any other action on your turns.
 4) Natural Attunement Your invent costs no Ki to perform.
 It benefits from Superior Enlarged Ki Blast based on its
 'normal' cost, but you do not actually pay any Ki or
 Endurance to fire it (or, if you have the appropriate add-on,
 Remote or Double Remote it). Additionally, this ease of use
 allows you to put more focus into refining the technique itself,
 increasing its base Invent Points by 5.
 Stat Booster:
 1) Awakening Your invent can be activated both swiftly and
 efficiently, making up for what it lacks in raw power with ease
 of use. It can be activated as a pre-round effect, at any point in
 the round without having to spend an action, and even in
 response to an attack (alongside another defense, like
 dodging or using a shield). Additionally, it has no Endurance
 cost (the XP penalty, however, remains).
 2) Vitality Surge Your stat booster can also raise the user's
 HP or Ki multipliers. It costs 10 Invent points for +1 to either
 mod, 20 for the next +1, 30 for the next, and so on (for a total
 of, in that case, 10+20+30 = 60 Invent Points for +3 to your
 HP or Ki multiplier; +1 to both, on the other hand, would cost
 only 10+10 = 20 Invent Points). Each multiplier point
 purchased this way adds 4 Endurance to your invent's cost.
 You may only purchase a total of +(level)/3 points to your
 multipliers, either split up or all on the same one.
 3) Overdrive Your invent's base points per level are lowered
 by 10. However, the user also deals +(level)*2% damage with
 all attacks (including TK and grapple attacks!) while it's
 active. This stacks additively with other percent-based
 increases (such as Berserker or Damaging Aura), and is
 halved for multis like normal.
 4) Second Wind When your stat booster is activated, the
 user regains 20% of their maximum HP, Ki, and End (though
 the stat booster's cost must still be paid), plus another 5% for
 every full round the battle has already gone for (i.e. 25% in
 round 2, 30% in round 3), to a maximum of 40% (if used in
 round 5 or later).

Wealth and Equipment
 The Short: Every character starts with 500 credits to make
 any purchases they want. Characters gain an additional 100
 credits per day, automatically. Fighting also grants more
 credits.
 Items may be sold back for half their original price if they
 are undamaged. Damaged or destroyed items cannot be sold
 back. Items that have an improved version of the same item 
such as Weighted Clothes 1, Dragon Radars and
 Rejuvenators can be upgraded to the next version by paying
 the difference cost.
 For example; Weighted Clothing 2 is 1000 Credits. Instead
 of having to fork out the full amount, if you already own
 Weighted Clothing 1, you could pay the difference of 600
 credits, lose your WC1 but gain the WC2.
 Trivial items that do not affect game mechanics, such as
 mundane clothing and shoes, do not cost enough credits to
 have a noticable effect on a character's wealth. They're
 essentially free.
 The Long: Credits
 Credits are magical gems about 3" in diameter. When
 credits come into contact with one another they fuse, their
 magical properties keep them the same shape and allow for
 them to be split apart as needed by the owner.
 Credits must be carried around on a person, if they are set
 down somewhere then they magically unsplit and shatter.
 However, safes can be purchased which have properties to
 keep them bundled together. Unfortunately, this also makes it
 possible for credits to be stolen from a person.
 All characters begin with 500 credits, plus another 100
 each neo week (real life day). New characters begin with 500
 credits, plus 100 credits every full 24 real hours of the reset
 they missed.
 Fighting also grants extra credits, as the gems absorb
 excess chi from battles. How they do this is unknown and
 does not always seem to occur. See Chapter 10, Section 1:
 Spoils of War for more details on how many credits are
 awarded from combat.
 Money is earned per full 24 hours since the beginning of
 the reset. There is no penalty or bonus for starting your
 character at a weird hour of the day. If the Reset begins at 5
 PM on the 5th, then at 5 PM on the 15th, all characters who
 have done nothing to alter their credit total (spent or received
 money in any fashion) will have 1,500 credits.
 Weapons
 Standard Weapons:
 All weapons, except the small weapon, may be used with
 sword powers. Weapons are melee only; ranged weapons are
 ineffective against people as strong as those in the Neo
 Universe and with exception to the small weapon, no
 weapons may be used in a grapple. Otherwise, you may
 design your weapons to be whatever you want it to be or look
 like. You may not upgrade one Weapon to another.
 Switching from sword or unarmed or one sword to another
 costs you no actions, because you're so quick with them!
 1) Light Weapon - 200 credits 1d10 damage per level, +3 to
 strike, gives a +4 bonus, instead of +3, when used with the
 sword power "Parrying Strike". Example Weapon: Bo Staff
 2) Medium Weapon - 240 credits 1d10 damage per level,
 SP, +2 to strike. Example Weapon: Long Sword
 3) Heavy Weapon - 280 credits 3d10 damage per level, AP,
 +30% base damage on Basic attacks Example Weapon:
 Bastard Sword Template: {(Sword Damage + Ki Enhance +
 STR Mod)*1.3+Misc+Bulk}
 4) Giant Weapon - 300 credits 2d10 damage per level,
 AP/SP, -3 Strike. Example Weapon: Great Axe
 5) Sharp Weapon - 400 credits 3d10 damage per level, SP
 Example Weapon: Katana
 6) Balanced Weapon - 350 2d10 damage per level, AP, +2
 Strike, -1 END Cost on all attacks (min 1). Example Weapon:
 Short Sword
 7) Small Weapon - 320 credits 1d10 damage, AP. This
 weapon can be used in grapples! It cannot be used with any
 sword powers except ki enhance. Ki enhance can be
 activated on this weapon at any time insted of being limited
 to preround, when it is being used to only enhance the blade
 and not for its ki attack. In place of the normal ki enhance
 damage bonus, it insted gains 1d10 damage per five ki spent,
 to a max of five ki per user's level. The Sword Power ki
 enhance must be obtained before this option can be used.
 Once it is used it gains the bonus to damage for the rest of
 the round.
 Daggers do not gain the benefit of level scaling damage,
 they are always 1d10 damage unless you ki enhance them.
 Ki-Enhancement Powers "Bulk" and its upgraded forms may
 be used with it. Example Weapon: Dagger
 Note In a defensive position in a grapple, the ki enhance
 benefit of the dagger cannot be used automatically. However,
 If the ki enhance was paid for preround, or anytime earlier in
 the round, it is in effect.

Scouters
 Scouters are used to detect the ki signatures of other
 warriors. Scouters may be used once every ten real life
 minutes to detect someone's power level, or once per
 preround if used in combat. The roll to determine if you
 receive a successful reading or not is (Scouter %
 chance)-1d100, where a 0 or higher is a success. Scouters
 cannot lock on to another warrior in combat without addons.
 If you are wearing a scouter and it breaks, it deals you no
 actual HP damage, but that doesn't mean it didn't hurt.
 1) Level 1 - 50 credits 70% chance of success, breaks if it
 reads a PL of 30,000 or more.
 2) Level 2 - 100 credits 80% chance of success, breaks if it
 reads a PL of 60,000 or more.
 3) Level 3 - 175 credits 90% chance of success, breaks if it
 reads a PL of 120,000 or more.
 4) Level 4 - 400 credits 100% chance of success, breaks if
 it reads a PL of 240,000 or more.
 5) Level 5 - 750 credits 125% chance of success, breaks if
 it reads a PL of 480,000 or more.
 6) Level 6 - 1,000 credits 200% chance of success, never
 breaks. This scouter allows you to save a specific aura it
 scans into data, so that it can recognize it at a later date (even
 if the power level is at a different number than before). It may
 store up to four auras, and no more. It cannot store the auras
 of androids to memory in this fashion, because they lack
 auras.
 Scouter addons:
 *Androids and Ghettis may purchase these addons and
 have them added to their racial scouters.
 Combat locking: 1200 credits. This addon DOES NOT
 stack with a ki sense lock. This ability allows the scouter to
 lock onto anything it can detect, this includes androids. The
 scouter tracks movements in combats and gives locations,
 because of this you gain +1 to all strikes and dodges. This
 ability DOES NOT stack from round to round like locking
 does. You gain nothing more than the +1.
 Communicator: 400 credits This adds a communicator
 unit that can contact any scouter on the same planet. This
 can also be used to communicate to dwellings, androids or
 other players with a scouter. To reply to someone who has
 contacted you with a scouter, you require the communicator
 addon.
 Trinkets
 Trinkets are some personally significant item that has been
 enhanced (through technology, magic, or something else that
 costs credits) to provide some benefit. It costs 1000 Credits
 to Enhance a Trinket, and it provides one of the following
 benefits.
 +10 INT
 5 MNT
 +15 STR
 5 DEX
 +10 STM
 5 SPD
 +Level x5 Sword Damage
 +Level x 5 Hand-to-Hand Damage
 +Level x5 Ki Damage, except Telekinetics
 +Level x 5 Telekinetic Damage
 +Level x 3 Resistance
 +Level x 3 Ki Regeneration
 +Level x 2 HP Regeneration
 +1 APR
 A character may only benefit from one trinket at a time.
 Once you receive a trinket's benefit for the battle, you may not
 change it until that battle is over. Stat bonuses are applied 
after- anything that multiplies your stats, such as most
 superforms.--=( Senzu Bean )=-- May not be purchased This is the rare
 and hard to aquire Senzu Bean. Very few shops are able to
 sell this plant, so purchasing one is extremely difficult or
 expensive. Eating this bean will restore 50% of your HP, Ki,
 End and cure any critical effect that does not involve a lost
 limb the victim is suffering from. You would however, ignore
 penalties associated with a lost limb for that fight. It takes an
 action to chew and swallow. A character in LP or SLP given
 this item are brought up to 1 HP and their LP/SLP are both
 restored to full. A dead character cannot benefit from this
 item. Using a Senzu Bean in anything but a Deathmatch or
 Guild War incurs a -100 XP Penalty. If you feel this penalty
 does not count for a team fight you intend to use it for, you
 may speak with a GM.--=( Flying Nimbus )=-- May not be purchased A small, semi
sentient cloud. This little cloud comes at the calling of its
 name and them the owner can then ride or stand on it for
 travel. It can fly at the owner's MNT30 MPH and can be used
 in a fight with no ki cost to the user, but must be declared
 preround. A Flying Nimbus can be 'killed,' - it has HP equal to
 the owner's level100 and any ki attacks that hit the person
 riding it also deal an additional 25% of their damage to the
 cloud, which does not reduce the damage dealt to the rider
 and does not decrease if the rider shields all or part of the
 damage. If 'killed', the Flying Nimbus poofs away and will
 regenerate back to full HP a Neo week (1 Real life day) after
 it has been destroyed and is once again available for use.--=( Spacesuits )=-- 500 credits per suit Whatever race, size,
 gender or style. Spacesuits are the new fashion statement for
 races without immunity to death. Or so it's advertised. When
 worn, you're immune to any atmosphere-based hostile
 environents. In a fight, you may use armor with a spacesuit
 providing it is worn over the spacesuit. If you're ever reduced
 to 0 HP, the suit is considered 'ruptured' and you lose LP and
 End, as if you were exposed to the hostile environment while
 you are unconcious. Suits cost nothing to fix, once you're
 awake, not wearing it and in a safe place. Suits may be
 patched with a repair kit, if no safe place is available,
 detailled below.--=( Suit Repair Kit )=-- 100 credits per consumable. A
 small toolkit box with last-ditch survival tools. You may seal a
 spacesuit up from the hostile environment by using up one of
 these kits. Obviously you must be concious to use one.

Dragon Radars
 Dragon Radars are used to detect Dragon Balls, items of
 mythical power that are said to grant wishes. Dragon Radars
 are generally a flat, circular object with a display on the large
 portion and a button to activate them on the top - which
 makes them woefully simple to operate even if you didn't read
 the manual. The exact mechanics of how a Dragon Radar
 works is unknown, except to a select few scientists and
 engineers who might not even give you a good answer if you
 asked.
 The Radars themselves are far from perfect, however and
 there's a chance when used that they fail to pick up a signal.
 To determine if a Dragon Radar finds any Dragonballs, roll
 (Radar% chance)-1d100, where a 0 or higher is a success. If a
 person in the chatroom possesses a dragonball that can be
 detected by this roll, they are required to reply with a 'ping' in
 whisper. If you think people are purposely withholding rolls
 or conveniently AFKing, you can contact a GM to resolve it.
 Each type of Radar may only be used once per every real
life day. Because of the limitations of OpenRPG/Discord, if a
 player rolls in one room and wishes to check another room
 for dragonballs, he may have a new roll for the new room.
 1) Cheap Dragon Radar - 1,000 credits 15% chance of
 success.
 2) Dragon Radar - 1,750 credits 30% chance of success.
 3) Improved Dragon Radar - 3,000 credits 50% chance of
 success.
 Armor
 There are four different types of armor, and each type of
 armor comes in four Ranks. Select the Rank you want, spend
 that amount of credits, and you gain the benefits appropriate
 to that rank. The costs and benefits are seperated by a slash.
 So a Rank 3 Namekian Armor costs 1200 Credits, has 900
 Armor, and grants Level*3 Ki Regeneration. Each type of
 armor has a different "Special" Benefit. When you wear
 Armor, this special benefit applies until the end of the
 combat, even if the armor loses all of its HP.--=( Repairing Armor )=--
 Repairing a suit of armor costs half its full cost in Credits,
 but restores it to full health. Armor that has been completely
 destroyed is gone and must be repurchased completely.--=( Upgrading Armor )=--
 You may upgrade armor by paying the difference in cost in
 credits.--=( Stacking Armor )=--
 You may only wear one armor from this section, which
 incures EXP penalties. This is in addition to any armor
 granted by your race and powers.--=( Armor Types )=--
 Humans Armor The human race has spread across the
 galaxy, it only makes sense that their technology does as well.
 The human armor is white, devoid of metal, it covers almost
 the entire body except the head. It evokes feelings of the
 ancient astronauts of the past except far more slender. It
 tends to be made with plastics and hypertextiled spidersilk
 (produced by the finest of hybrid cloned goats of course).
 Cost: 300 / 600 / 1200 / 2400 Credits Armor: 300 / 600 / 900
 / 1200 HP Special: +10 / +20 / +30 / +40 Resistance
 Kuwain Armor The Kuwain armor is similar to the saiyan
 armor - it feels soft, it has battleplate motifs, however almost
 all their designs center from a off palate colored diamond
 found in the center of the back/chest. It is also more solid,
 made of a flexable metallic feeling substance which fits
 around the user like a breastplate - open it up, step in, close
 it, seal the latches. Cost: 300 / 600 / 1200 / 2400 Credits
 Armor: 400 / 800 / 1200 / 1600 HP Special: None
 Namekian Armor Namekian armor is nothing special,
 seeming to be nothing more than a turban, a cape, or a robe.
 However it has a touch of mysticism as a result of their
 spiritual nature, crafted out of their mental energies in a
 condensed form, it can prove to far surpass expectations
 Cost: 300 / 600 / 1200 / 2400 Credits Armor: 300 / 600 / 900
 / 1200 HP Special: +Level*( 1 / 2 / 3 / 4) Ki Regeneration
 Saiyan Armor Saiyan battle armor feels much like a
 flexible version of kevlar, the material designed into plates
 which link together with or without shoulderpads. It is often
 intimidatd to borrow from its primary user's ability for
 intimidation and effiency. It is one thing a race of warriors get
 right, its their battle gear, keep it simple and keep it effective.
 Cost: 300 / 600 / 1200 / 2400 Credits Armor: 250 / 500 / 750
 / 1000 HP Special: +Level*( 2 / 3 / 4 / 5) to all Damages

Ships
 If you wish to upgrade your ship, you may pay the difference
 in cost to upgrade, which is roleplayed as a part-exchange for
 the new ship. If a ship loses HP, it can be repaired for 1 credit
 per 10 HP it has. A ship with 0 HP has been damaged
 beyond repair and no longer functions. When a ship is
 destroyed and someone is inside, the ship takes the full
 damage that destroyed it (including excess that might be
 considered to go onto the occupant) and its original
 maximum HP is dealt in SP/AP damage to each individual
 inside.
 For obvious reasons, none of the listed ships below are
 capable of having a Dwelling inside them or a Guild Haven
 and vise versa.
 1) Pod Ship - 200 credits Podships are little more than
 spheres used to send a single person from point A to point B,
 with barely any space for storage. Podships are very basic
 and have no communications equipment or anything
 similarily advanced. Navigation in podships is limited to
 telling the computer to go to a point, and it will do so
 automatically as best it can. Podships have 50 resistance,
 250 HP and travel 0.5 light years per hour. A podship fits only
 a single person.
 2) Capsule Corps Ship - 500 Credits Capsule Corps Ships
 are larger than podships, and much more spacious. Despite
 this, CapCorp ships act as a podship in most other ways, they
 have equal technology and navigation abilities. CapCorp
 Ships are, however, well-known for the ability to be micro
sized into a pea-sized tablet which easily fits in a pocket,
 which can later be inflated back to full size again with the
 push of a button. For an extra 100 credits, it can have some
 space made and fit with a Rejuvenator. Capsule Corps ships
 have 75 resistance, 500 HP and travel 1 light year per hour.
 CapCorp ships can fit up to two people.
 3) Light Star Cruiser - 1500 Credits Light Star Cruisers
 are the ship types that are used for 'light' travel, whether
 military scouting trips or a rich boy's joy ride. These vary in
 size and shape but are significantly larger can CapCorp
 ships, and much more advanced. This ship type has working
 communications equipment, sensors to detect other ships
 and the like. It can even be manually pilotted, but the average
 individual will just use the autopilot. Light Star Cruisers have
 150 resistance, 1000 HP and travel 3 light years per hour.
 These ships can fit up to four people and has enough room to
 hold a rejuvenator, which must be acquired seperately. Due to
 its speed and firepower, it can easily destroy ships of smaller
 classes than itself.
 4) Heavy Star Cruiser - 3500 Credits Heavy Star Cruisers
 are the largest type of ships that can be considered 'personal'
 ships and are sometimes restricted from sale. Most military
 fighters are just barely larger than the average ship of this
 type. These ships tend to sport slightly more advanced
 equipment than their lighter cousins, having working
 communications, sensors, better navigation abilities and the
 like. These ships can also be manually pilotted, but the ship's
 computer probably does it better than you ever could. Heavy
 Star Cruisers have 225 resistance, 1500 HP and travel 4
 light years per hour. These ships can fit up to eight people
 and has enough room to hold two rejuvenators, which must
 be acquired seperately. Due to its speed and heavy firepower,
 it can easily destroy ships of smaller classes than itself.

Dwellings
 Dwellings are the homes and bases of solitary Neo DBZ
 warriors. Although they do not have to be a house, exactly,
 dwellings are intended to be places where the owner lives or
 spends their time resting. Dwellings are always something
 physical, such as a structure or a cave, that can be destroyed
 or broken into.
 Each character may only own a single dwelling and only
 the owner benefits from the furnishings and add-ons (not
 including Rejuvenators). Their friends may still visit and
 enter, of course. Since only the owner can benefit from it,
 dwellings may not be stolen in any fashion. When buying or
 owning a Dwelling, ensure the details are recorded
 somewhere on your sheet for referance.
 Selling a dwelling is possible, but you do not get the value
 of the addons returned - only the value of the Dwelling itself
 and any rejuvinators it might have.
 If a group of characters wish it, they may combine their
 dwellings and become "housemates". This does not mean
 that the total HP + resistance is combined, but it is now
 shared between your two properties. This still does not allow
 them access to your addons, but it does give them access to
 your Dwelling (meaning they can buy their own addons).
 Several characters living together under one roof is a good
 basis for forming a guild. For obvious reasons, a Dwelling
 cannot be placed inside a Guild Haven and vise versa.
 Dwellings are not spacious enough to fight inside of. If a
 fight occurs within a dwelling, ki blasts deal full damage to
 the dwelling regardless of whether they hit their target or not.
 Hand-to-hand and sword attacks deal damage to the dwelling
 if they miss their intended target.
 Should you ever wish to Enter or Exit a Dwelling during a
 fight (bare in mind it should already exist in the scene and not
 be destroyed); you need to spend 2 consecutive actions
 entering or exitting the Dwelling. For all other information,
 follow the normal guidelines for Fleeing.
 Should you ever wish to destroy/attack a Dwelling, the
 owner or housemates (if present) can interrupt your attack. If
 they are unavailable to defend it, you're free to do so. Make
 sure you know the house doesn't possess the Capsule
 addons, before attacking. If it does have the capsule addons,
 it usually means it stays with its owner most of the time.
 Destroying a Dwelling without the Safe addon drops any
 valuables it had inside it.
 Should you ever wish to steal from a Dwelling, you're free
 to do so providing the owner or housemates (if present) can
 interrupt you. Otherwise, it is dependant on if the house
 possesses a secure enterance or a safe. Safe's are
 uncrackable personal vaults in NeoDBZ and prevent theft
 from Dwellings.
 Basic Dwelling - 300 credits This must be purchased before
 any other dwelling add-ons. This is the structure of a
 dwelling, the most basic thing that could be considered a
 'home' of any sort, although it is not required to be a building.
 Only one Dwelling may be owned at any one time by one
 person, nor can you buy this multiple times for stacking
 effect. Basic dwellings start with 500 HP and 0 resistance. If
 the Dwelling is ever damaged, it may be repaired at the rate
 of 1 credits per 10 HP. Once it has been brought to 0 HP, the
 dwelling and all dwelling add-ons within in it are permanently
 damaged beyond repair.
 Pretty Dwelling - 1000 credits An optional upgrade from
 the Basic Dwelling or Bought for full price as its own kind of
 house. Maybe the architecture is particularly grand or the
 interior is luxurious. Whatever the case, it is simply better
 than its cheaper counterpart. Only one Dwelling may be
 owned at any one time by one person, nor can you buy this
 multiple times for stacking effect. Pretty dwellings start with
 1500 HP and 50 resistance. If the Dwelling is ever damaged,
 it may be repaired at the rate of 1 credits per 10 HP. Once it
 has been brought to 0 HP, the dwelling and all dwelling add
ons within in it are permanently damaged beyond repair.
 Reinforced Dwelling - 3000 credits An optional upgrade
 from the Basic Dwelling, Pretty Dwelling or Bought for full
 price as its own kind of house. This sturdy building is
 reinforced to the brim with powerful icons and is simply
 better than most in every field. Not only that, but you've made
 sure to include training space so you can fight inside without
 damaging the Dwelling and still benefit from whatever you
 add onto your house, which can optionally (only during the
 fight) be included for your opponent to enjoy - this doesn't
 give them access to your safe to store money, for example, but
 they could benefit from your Increased Healing: Ki addon.
 Only one Dwelling may be owned at any one time by one
 person, nor can you buy this multiple times for stacking
 effect. Reinforced dwellings start with 2000 HP and 100
 resistance. If the Dwelling is ever damaged, it may be
 repaired at the rate of 1 credits per 10 HP. Once it has been
 brought to 0 HP, the dwelling and all dwelling add-ons within
 in it are permanently damaged beyond repair.
 Advanced Dwelling - 2000 credits An optional upgrade
 from the Basic Dwelling, Pretty Dwelling or Bought for full
 price as its own kind of house. This house is the pinnicle of
 modern science and economical to boot. You might not enjoy
 some luxuries others enjoy, but you have your ways.
 Whenever an addon is purchased for an Advanced Dwelling,
 you're actually getting double your money's worth! You gain
 two of the item (not Rejuvenators, though it does allow for
 two to be installed), up to its normal maximum limits. Not to
 mention it's reasonably tough. Only one Dwelling may be
 owned at any one time by one person, nor can you buy this
 multiple times for stacking effect. Advanced dwellings start
 with 1500 HP and 50 resistance. If the Dwelling is ever
 damaged, it may be repaired at the rate of 1 credits per 20
 HP. Once it has been brought to 0 HP, the dwelling and all
 dwelling add-ons within in it are permanently damaged
 beyond repair.

Rejuvenator Addition - 300 credits This addition allows you
 to install a Rejuvenator inside your dwelling. This ability can
 only be purchased once. Rejuvenators do not stack with the
 Increased Healing: HP Improvement. However if your
 Rejuvenator does not grant ki regen you may benefit from
 increased Healing: Ki.
 Structure Improvement - 30 credits This improves the
 dwelling's HP by 10 each time it is purchased.
 Structure Reinforcement - 10 credits This improves the
 dwelling's resistance by 1 each time it is purchased.
 Secure Entrance - 10 credits Any character may enter any
 dwelling without this add-on without impediment. Once this
 is purchased, it requires anyone who wishes to forcefully
 enter to deal the Dwelling damage equal to 5% of its
 maximum HP before they may enter. This may be purchased
 multiple times, each time increasing the amount of damage
 that must be dealt by 5%, to a maximum of 95%. Such
 security is always one-way. Characters cannot imprison
 others in their dwelling with this add-on.
 Capsule Dwelling - 300 credits The Dwelling may now be
 micro-sized into a pea-sized tablet which easily fits into a
 pocket. It can later be inflated back to full size again with the
 push of a button. It will not inflate in a space it cannot fit in.
 This upgrade is incompatible with Safe, Secure Enterance
 and the Rejuvenator Addition. If stolen, the dwelling will re
inflate as soon as it has enough space to. This may only be
 bought once.
 Improved Capsule Dwelling - 500 credits The Dwelling,
 when micro-sized, may now hold any number of items when it
 shrinks which will not be damaged. This add-on requires that
 Capsule Dwelling already be bought and may only be bought
 once. It unlocks the previous restrictions Capsule Dwelling
 possessed.
 Communications Equipment - 15 credits While normal
 houses might come with a telephone, caves and log cabins in
 the wilderness do not. Comm equipment is some fairly
 advanced technology that lets you communicate with any
 other dwelling that also has this add-on, or anything else with
 similar comm equipment. You cannot force another dwelling
 to listen to your transmission, however. This may only be
 bought once.
 Scramble Effects - 50 credits per level This add-on,
 whether through rare types of insulation or advanced
 technology, lowers the chance to detect someone in their
 dwelling, either with scouters or the Sense Ki power, by 5%.
 This also causes anyone within a dwelling with this addon,
 the same penalty to sense or scout those outside of it. This
 affects everyone inside the dwelling and not just the owner.
 This does not alter the chances of success for Dragon
 Radars. This can be purchased multiple times, to a maximum
 of once per every experience level of the owner, each time
 lowering the chance of detection by an additional 5%.
 Increased Healing: HP - 500 credits Whether through
 proper medical stores, a pet medical bot, a really nice natural
 hot spring that happens to bubble up in your dwelling, or
 anything else the player wishes, this increases the owner's
 healing rate inside the dwelling by +5% of his maximum HP
 per Neo hour. This may only be bought once. In rare
 circumstances, this can even be used in combat, which grants
 the owner level*2 HP per action he's inside the building.
 Table of
 Contents
 Increased Healing: Ki - 500 credits Whether through some
 really inspiring feng shui, a personal meditation chamber, or
 anything else the player wishes, this increases the owner's
 healing rate inside the dwelling by +5% of his maximum Ki
 per Neo hour. This may only be bought once. In rare
 circumstances, this can even be used in combat, which grants
 the owner level*2 Ki per action he's inside the building.
 Safe - 50 credits Normally, credits cannot be left sitting on
 the ground without them dispersing into whatever magic
 causes them to have their value. Once this is purchased, a
 character may choose to store 5% of their total credits in
 their dwelling instead of carrying them around with him. This
 may be purchased multiple times, each time increasing the
 storage capacity of the safe by another 5%, up to a maximum
 of 80% credit storage. Credits not stored in safes must be
 carried by the character. If a character is robbed of all his
 credits and he has a safe at his Dwelling, he cannot be
 robbed again until he gets a chance to fully recover (from the
 fight, if there was one). He must also take enough credits out
 of his safe so that it only contains its maximum % of his
 wealth. If someone destroys a Dwelling with the Safe addon,
 the Safe is left intact and cannot be stolen or stolen from.
 Because of magic.
 Speaking of Magic, I wish we had a space boat.

Advancement
 In NeoDBZ, levels are rather important. They provide stats,
 unlock new powers and abilities, improve defenses and
 damage. Levels are broken down based on Experience
 Points, which can be gained by doing a number of things in
 the game, detailed below.
 Remember that activity on the server is logged.
 Encounters
 Perhaps the simpliest form of XP generation is roleplay,
 dubbed Encounters. An Encounter with another player first
 requires you to successfully sense them and head in their
 direction in whatever way you'd prefer (flight, walking, etc).
 Usually players will ask who wishes to roleplay in chat,
 then arrange something with whoever responds. However,
 this is not required and you can simply roll your sense or
 scouter to detect someone and go and find what you detected.
 If you fail to detect a person, it means you can't 'feel' the
 direction a person with power is and thus cannot go and
 meet them. However, if both participants agree, they can
 meet you anyway - you just wouldn't know they are a powerful
 person. Until you successfully roll sense. When meeting in
 this way; ensure that you have a good reason for picking one
 person out of a crowd or being in a particular place.
 Scenes can be anything, provided it makes sense in the
 restarts' setting and can be described as anything you want it
 to be. You could create a large and detailled castle with no
 mechanical benefits because you don't have a dwelling on
 Earth, if you wanted - so long as it makes sense or doesn't
 effect anything beyond its function as a background for your
 interactions.
 Encounters grant you and participants 25 XP per 15
 Minutes. The first time you RP for at least one hour during
 any day, you gain +100 Bonus EXP.
 You cannot claim Encounter XP, if you're in a scene where
 there is not another person also in the Encounter. For
 example, if your partner began a fight with a third person, you
 cannot claim Encounter XP even if he fights and roleplays
 with you, because you're on your own. If a fourth person were
 to arrive, you could roleplay with them and claim off their
 participation. You're welcome to roleplay with yourself, but
 you can't claim XP off it.
 For interesting or well-written Encounters, GMs may
 award Bonus XP that they witness. If you believe that
 something is worthy of a bonus, you can choose to 'log' the
 roleplay in a node and send it to a GM. Include timestamps.
 Events
 Events are a little trickier than Encounters or Fights
 (detailled below), since they have no reliable XP ammount or
 frequency, but are usually important for plot developments
 and character development. Generally speaking; an Event is
 anything run by a GM. This can be a tournament, a random
 NPC showing up to talk to someone or a full blown battle
 between good and evil.
 If you wish to run stories and events for other players, you
 can apply to be a storytelle by contacting a GM.
 When an event is forming, usually a GM or ST will warn
 oocly that one is due at x time. This is not to say that it will
 definately happen, if their criteria is not met and people are
 not available or other situations, but that they wish to run
 something and are asking for interest in attending.
 Population might be limited in events, so they can handle
 what is going on.
 During fight events, special rules or alternative Fighting
 may occur that tries to speed up large fights. Please have
 your posts ready for when your action comes by.
 There is no limit to the ammount of Event XP one person
 can aquire, however GMs and STs should try to involve
 people who have not had the luxury of being in events
 frequently, more than players with a high Event XP Total.
 Fighting
 Perhaps the most common form of experience, is battling
 another person. Like an encounter, it requires you to find a
 suitable opponent either by asking in OOC and successfully
 sensing/scounting them or by simply finding someone IC and
 asking them if they wish to train with you. Generally training
 in this way is pre-arranged OOCly between a pair or more,
 but like all forms of XP generation, is not fixed in this way.
 Like an encounter, if you fail to detect your decided
 opponent, without their permission you cannot go and find
 them until you successfully sense or scout them. If you're
 roleplaying prior to the fight, you need to have logged a full
 hour of consistant Encounter XP to claim it.
 If you're new, do not be concerned about taking a long time
 to decide actions or fight. The only way to learn is to play it,
 then you'll quickly speed up once you understand what you're
 doing. Just make sure to warn your opponent that you're new,
 so that he or she may be able to help you out during the fight
 or point out mistakes so that you can learn. Spectators
 should refrain from chiming in where possible.
 Be warned, however, because there are different
 classification of fights and some are indeed, quite deadly! See
 the "Spoils of War" node supplied further in this section of
 the PHB for more information. If you are not certain what
 type of fight you're entering, ask your opponent in OOC. Also
 be aware that Credits and Items are on your person unless
 you have a Dwelling with a Safe and record that you have
 stored them, which can be stolen if you're unconcious.
 Opponents with a vapourized body cannot be looted.
 If you fight a person you have already fought within a 16
 hour period, you do not recieve XP from it. If you fight a
 person who was the last person you fought, regardless of the
 time apart, you only recieve 50% XP. Fights that you do not
 gain Experience from, must still be logged and exploitation of
 this is punishable.
 As a side note, if you lose a fight the credits gained do not
 come from you. So you're not losing money, don't worry.

For good roleplay during fights, GMs may award Bonus XP
 that they witness. If you believe that something is worthy of a
 bonus, you can choose to 'log' the fight in a node and send it
 to a GM. Include timestamps.
 No single "team" in a fight may contain more than 3
 fighters at one time. A fighter may "tag" in or out, changing
 who is in that 3v3 lineup inbetween rounds. If you tag out,
 you may -not- flee the combat unless your opponents all agree
 to allow you. There are a lot of "what if" situations that arise
 from this rule, such as what happens during a betrayal.
 Because any rules to handle these fringe situations would
 have to be far too detailed and far-reaching to cover every
 situation, the GMs have the freedom to arbtirate any and all
 "special cases."
 Rewards and Penalties
 Winning a Fight grants 200 XP and 100 credits
 Losing a Fight grants 125 XP and 25 credits
 Tieing a Fight grants 150 XP and 50 credits
 Bonuses to Fights Only
 +10 XP for every level the highest level person on the
 opposing team is above you. If you win or tie the fight, this
 has a max bonus of 30.
 +25 XP for each round you go into during the battle - max
 bonus of 75 (Round 3).
 +50 XP for going into LP. You do not get this bonus if you
 win the fight somehow.
 +50 XP For being outnumbered. Only opponent who are
 your (Level-2) or higher count for this purpose.
 +10 XP for each opponent beyond the first who outlevels
 you.
 +100 XP for your First Fight per OOC Day, regardless of
 whether you win or lose.
 Penalties to Fights Only-25 XP for each level they were under you.-50 XP fighting during schooling.-100 XP for using a Personal Invent in Round 1, except
 Statbooster-50 XP for using a Personal Invent in Round 2, except
 Statbooster.-50 XP for using a School Invent, Statbooster or Non
Permanent Superform in Round 1.-25 XP for using a School Invent, Statbooster or Non
Permanent Superform in Round 2.
 You receive no experience or credits at all if you kill your
 target without declaring a Deathmatch.
 The follow penalties only apply when using any "Type One"
 powers.-25 EXP for any level X power used in round one-50 EXP for any level X2 power used in round one-100 EXP for any level Z power used in round one-25 EXP for any level X2 power used in round two-50 EXP for any level Z power used in round two
 Wearing armor in a fight causes the person's XP to be
 reduced by 50% of the EXP they should have aquired, after all
 other reductions are applied. Armor granted by your Race or
 Uniques does not incure this penalty.
 Deathmatches
 Anyone may declare a Deathmatch against one or more
 targets as a Pre-Round action or by taking an action. This
 declaration of intent is always obvious, whether because of a
 public announcement or the ferocity of your attacks. Take
 that moment to milk the RP, then look back here to see what
 happens.
 All participants in the fight do not receive EXP penalties
 for killing their opponent; or using any powers, invents,
 statboosters or superforms, regardless of how many
 rounds the fight has gone on.
 The person who declared the Deathmatch gains the
 following benefits:
 +50 EXP and +50 Credits are added to a "Prize Pool" you
 win if you kill your opponent at the beginning of each
 round. If you declared as a pre-round action, then the
 round you declare counts. Otherwise, you must wait until
 the beginning of the next round to start accruing this
 bonus.
 +50 EXP and +50 Credits for declaring a Deathmatch as a
 pre-round action in round 1.
 No penalty for wearing armor if you declare a Deathmatch
 as a pre-round action in round 1.
 The bonuses and penalties for fighting someone of a
 higher or lower level are doubled.
 If you declare a Deathmatch against a Restricted Race
 and kill them, you receive +100 XP and +1 Rep.
 You receive no experience, credits or reputation at all if
 you do not successfully kill your target. If your target lives
 due to Sub-LP, Venguard School, or a similar mechanic
 then you still get XP and Credits but not Rep. If you abuse
 this privledge there will be repercussions.
 Note that you may declare a Deathmatch against your
 opponent after they declare one against you to receive the
 same benefits. If the deathmatch was declared as a pre-round
 action you may still match them as a pre-round action.
Other Training
 Daily Life and Training Days
 Your character doesn't hide in some box until a fight or an RP
 comes along. Your character is highly motivated by real world
 standards, and keeps improving themselves. Every 24 hours,
 you gain 100 Credits and 1 Reputation, as well as one of the
 options listed below:
 +1 to one of your Stats. No more than half your bonus
 from training days may go to one stat, rounded up.
 +1 additional Reputation
 +200 additional Credits
 Learn a School (takes 4 Training Days in a row!)
 Learn a Racial Power (takes an amount of Training days
 spent in a row as listed in the power's entry)
 If you create late, you gain training days for the days you
 were not here.
 Experience Training
 Even if you can't fight or RP, your character can still gain XP.
 During this down time, your character will continue to
 develop their skills, even if only through simple choors or
 light workouts.
 Every 24 hours where your character does not RP or Fight,
 you can log 400 XP under the Battle Log. If you RP or Fight
 but earn less than 400 EXP in a 24-hour period you may
 instead choose to take EXP Training.
 At a certain point training alone will become far less
 advantageous. In game terms, this means any EXP training
 that is done after you have hit level 10 is halved. Meaning you
 would gain 200 EXP per 24 hours of inactivity, beyond level
 10.
 Reputation
 This section should be moved to an earlier point in the PHB.
 For the time being, however, here is a brief explanation!
 Reputation is considered an intangible form of currency for
 some, required to enter high-grade Schools or convince
 famous smiths to produce fine weaponry for you. It is gained
 passively as a character progresses daily at a rate of 1 per
 day, but can be taken through extreme means such as
 Deathmatches, providing you're successful.
 Characters are fully aware of their overall 'Rep' as it grows
 and thankfully cannot be stolen. This also means it cannot be
 transferred (though you could buy a sword worth rep and give
 it to someone). Though it could be tarnished by fleeing a
 Deathmatch.
 Some Tournaments or Events could also effect Reputation
 positively or negatively, so be aware of this.
 Leveling Up; the Quick
 and Dirty Guide.
 Finally, compiled (and updated) into one small, easy to use
 guide, the step to step basics of leveling up a Neo DBZ
 character. This is simply a guiding hand of what to do in
 order, but you're by no means limited by this step by step
 guide.
 1) Stat Points:
 Check your racial information and uniques for how many
 stat points you are allocated upon leveling up. Most races get
 5 points, but it doesn't hurt to check as you might get more
 from a unique or special level that your race enjoys. Once
 you've allocated all your stats, you can move onto the next
 part.
 2) Powers:
 Depending on your racial information, you recieve a
 number of powers each level up. Without any unique
 alteration, you're allowed a maximum of half (rounded down)
 of the powers in each tree. These powers can also be used to
 purchase Racial Powers, assuming you meet the
 prerequisties to do so.
 3) Invents:
 Next, update your personal Invents and School Invents.
 Some levels might also give you access to additional invents.
 A level means more points for personal invents to improve
 and always means more damage or defense!
 4) Secondry Attributes:
 Each time you level, your HP, LP, End and Ki (amongst
 other things) tends to improve. Make sure you check that
 these stats have next been updated. Some races gain HP
 mods and so on when they level, so look out for those
 goodies! Also you DO count level 1, for things like resistances
 etc.
 5) Refiguring:
 Finally, you double check if any of your rollers have
 changed as a result of your stat increases. You also
 recalculate your power level and anything else that might've
 been changed, such as APR or Init.
